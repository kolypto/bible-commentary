## Deuteronomy

24:1: **Indecency** literally is “the nakedness of a thing”. Some interpret it as repeated indecent exposure. 
The only other place where the word is used is in Dt 23:13-14 where it relates to an uncovered excrement: “Because the LORD your God walks in the midst of your camp ... your camp must be holy, so that he may not see anything indecent among you and turn away from you.”.
So the word actually means every kind of improper, shameful, or indecent behavior unbecoming to a woman and embarrassing to her husband. It cannot refer to adultery, because death was the penalty for that. 
What kind of indecency, then, would lead to the certificate of dismissal? It must have been sins of unfaithfulness and promiscuity that stopped just short of actual adultery.
(MacArthur)

24:1: This passage neither commands nor condones divorce, but simply recognizes it as a reality. The focus of that passage is not the question of whether or not divorce is permitted: it does not provide for divorce, much less command it. It shows how improper divorce leads to adultery, which results in defilement. A woman is defiled because of the adultery brought about by her second marriage. Moses is saying, then, that the divorce for indecency or promiscuity creates an adulterous situation. (MacArthur)
