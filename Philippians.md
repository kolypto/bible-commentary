## Philippians

2:7: Jesus trusted His Father. When He was incarnate, when he took up humanity, he was willing to **give up** His **equality** to God: he ceased to exercise some of His divine qualities. For instance, by a willing ristriction of His omniscience, He did not even know when the second coming would occur! He limited Himself only to what His Father willed. Consequently, in those self-imposed limitations, He had to entrust Himself to God, because He did not at that time know everything that could be known. Consequently, He had to operate in the mode of trust.  (MacArthur)

4:6: We simply do not realize how much time and trouble we would be saving ourselves by praying about matters instead of running around trying to handle them by our own efforts (John Strohman)
