## John

1:12: To **receive** Christ is 1) to comprehend the facts of the Gospel, 2) to believe that they are true, and 3) to engage oneself in appropriating them for your life. (MacArthur)

1:14: **dwelt** is literally "tabernacled". The term for tabernacle is *mishkan*, which comes from *shakan*, meaning to dwell, rest, or abide. From that root the term *shekinah* has also come, referring to the presence of God's glory. The child born was to be the Shekinah, the true Tabernacle of God. (MacArthur)

1:19: In the OT, on Rosh Hashanah (Jewish new year, the most holy day of the year, and the day of redemption), the sins of God’s people were transferred onto a scapegoat and were re.
That scapegoat is seens as a type, a foreshadowing, of the self-sacrifice of Jesus Christ, the **lamb of God** Who **takes away the sin of the world**. The type is fulfilled in that God has laid the sins of all humanity on Jesus, who was the redeeming pascal lamb for the whole mankind. That is the basis for redemption of everyone who believes in Jesus Christ as a Messiah who came to save us from the original sin of Adam. (Wikipedia)

1:46: The town of **Nazareth** was inhabited largely by people noted for their crude and violent ways. The term "**Nazarene**" ahd long been a term of derision, used to describe any person who was rough and rude. That is why **Nathanael **(from Cana, a few miles to the south) asked **Philip** that question. Nathanael was not given to maligning his neighbors (v. 47, "no guile"), but he was shocked that the one "of whom Moses wrote" (v. 45) actually could come from such a disreputable place as Nazareth. (MacArthur)

1:48: **Nathanael** must have had some intense moments under that **fig tree**, and he must have been sure that only God could've heard him — because when he learns that Jesus saw him, he calls Jesus “Son of God".

1:48: **Under a fig tree**. What’s he doing under a fig tree?
Basically in Palestine, fig trees were planted around houses as well as places where they would be harvested as a crop. And a fig tree is tall and wide, and provided a very great shade area. And in many of the poorer homes, there was only one room and there was little breeze very often, and so you could go out under the fig tree and you could find shade and comfort and coolness. But beyond that, a fig tree became the only place you could go to get away from the house, and the hustle and bustle of what was going on inside. And so, it became a place of retreat. It became a place of respite.  It became a place to be alone. It became a place of prayer, and a place of meditation, and a place of contemplation, a place of communing with God, a place of searching the Scripture, a place of quietness. And it may well be that Nathanael was out under the fig tree, as so many Jews did, and he was meditating and he was praying, in the quietness and the solitude, away from the activity of the house.  He was seeking God in the privacy of the shade of the fig tree.
And Jesus is saying to him: I saw you.  I saw you meditating, I saw you seeking, I saw your open heart.  I saw you in the secret place, the private place.  I saw your true desire.  I saw what was there and what you wanted to know, and I’m here.
Well, here was Nathanael very possibly praying under the fig tree, “Lord, show me Your Messiah.”  And here comes Philip shooting under the branches saying, “Nathanael, I found Him, your prayer is answered.”  He’s from Nazareth.  And then, Nathanael says, “Ah, you’ve got to be kidding.” Okay.  His desire overwhelmed his prejudice and off he went. (MacArthur)

1:50: **Because I said to you, ‘I saw you under the fig tree,’ do you believe?** It shouldn’t be a question, it’s a statement. The reason you believe is because of My omniscience. You were convinced that only God can know everything. My omniscience convinced you who I was. 
Jesus then says, “Listen, **you’re going to see greater things than that**, my friend. You have only just begun to see.” He was knocked over by one little act of omniscience. (MacArthur)

1:51:** Angels descending**. He’s saying this: Nathanael, You think you saw divine power in that one act of omniscience? From here on you’re going to see stuff going on all the time between heaven and earth. You’re going to see heaven open. And he has. Miracle, after miracle, after miracle. (MacArthur)

2:15: Jesus actually has disrupted the normal functioning of the Temple: animals were sold to be sacrificed, and money-changers enabled foreigners to change their money to the currency accepted by the Temple.

3:1: The fact that he came **at night** suggests he was ashamed of being seen with Jesus. (MacArthur)

3:1: Had he not had a deep, compelling desire to know God’s will, he would not have risked coming to Jesus even at night. **Nicodemus** was honest enough to admin his sinfulness. He was a **Pharisee**, a teacher of the law, and a **ruler** in the Sanhedrin; but he knew in his heart that all of that did not make him right with God. (MacArthur)

3:2: Even though Nicodemus did not ask a question, Jesus knew the question he had on his heart.

3:2: We are not told specifically what his intentions were in coming to Jesus because his first words were not a question but a testimony. Though he does not state it, the question that was on his mind is implied from his testimony and from Jesus’ reply. The Lord knew Nicodemus’ mind and the question he had: Nicodemus wanted to know how to please God, how to be forgiven. How can he be made righteous? how to be redeemed and become a child of God? How can he become part of God’s kingdom? (MacArthur)

3:3:  "**Water**" cannot refer to the breaking of water when a person is physically born. Jesus cannot be saying to Nicodemus that a man has to be physically born because it was obvious he'd already passed that test. Secondly, the Jews didn't call that "water", they did not have that expression, and we cannot read modern language into it. Other had said that He referred to baptism, but Christian was not even instituted until Acts 2.
Remember that Nicodemus was a ruler of the Jews (v. 1), a religious authority. How, then, Nicodemus have understood the saying? As a Christian baptistm? — No. The answer goes back to Ezekiel 36:25-27: "I will sprinkle clean water on you, and you shall be clean from all your uncleannesses [...] and I will give you a new heart, and a new spirit I will put within you. [...] and cause you to walk in my statutes and be careful to obey my rules". What Ezekiel is writing there is that the day will come when the Lord will wash your heart, He'll wash your life, He'll wash your inner man, He'll put a new heart in you, and He'll put His Spirit in you. So when Jesus talks to Nicodemus and says "you must be born **of water and the Spirit**", Nicodemus knows immediately that He is saying "I am come to bring the fulfillment of the new covenant promised through Ezekiel". That's what Paul would call "the [internal] washing of regeneration and the renewing [that comes by] the Holy Spirit" (Tit 3:5)
(MacArthur)

3:16: There’s a **faith** that’s temporary, partial, inadequate, that’s different than the faith that saves.  John 3:16, the word there “**believe**”, “**whosoever believes shall not perish**,” the word “believe” there is the same word in John 2:24 translated “commit – commit.”  It’s something deeper than just believing facts; it’s committing one’s life, turning from sin, submitting to Christ, and the Spirit of God works it all and produces a changed life.  You see, salvation and saving faith is more than wanting forgiveness, it’s more than wanting heaven; it’s being willing to turn from sin and submit to Christ.  Yet, beloved, shockingly – and I say that advisedly – shockingly, there are Bible teachers and preachers in fundamental evangelicalism who do not allow for any connection necessarily between faith and works.  And therefore they are forced to receive as genuine virtually every profession of faith, because if there’s not necessarily a correlation between faith and works, then any profession is a valid one. 
(MacArthur)

3:16: See also note on Jn 14:15 which explains how faith means obedience.

5:25: Spiritually **dead** — those currently dead in sin — **will** come to **life**. (See: "you were dead in trespasses and sins" (Eph 2:6); " let the dead bury their own dead" (Mt 8:22)).

5:27: **Son of Man** is a reference to the "son of man" of Daniel, Who is Messiah. Jesus will judge because He is the Messiah. (Андроник)

5:27: **Judgment** is not primarily about the verdict, or the punishment, but first of all, about revealing the truth. (Андроник)

6:2: **The crowd** was following Jesus not because they wanted to learn from His teachings, but because they wanted to be entertained by His miracles, or perhaps, even benefit from them.

6:6: What kind of “**test**” might that be? How would Philip pass this test, or fail? How could he possibly have known what Jesus **would do**? Perhaps, Jesus had done things like this before, and He expected Philip to ask Jesus to feed the crowd? 

6:6: When God **tests** a person, who is going to learn something new from that test? Definitely not God, but the person. What was Philip going to learn about himself from that test?

6:6: The **test** was in the expectation of people sharing the little they had with them with each other. And indeed, a boy came forth who had some food (v. 9)

6:8: **Andrew**. In all the incidents that we see Andrew involved in, he is always doing the same thing: he's bringing people to Christ. He brought his brother Peter, he brought the boy with the fishes. He even did not hesitate to bring gentiles to Christ: this tells us about the openness of his heart, he probably thought that there is no one who Christ would not want to see. He also had faith: we do not know what he was thinking about when he brought this boy with some crackers and pickled fish, but he definitely believed that the Lord could do something with that. After all, Andrew had seen Jesus make wine; why couldn't he make food? (MacArthur)

6:7-8: Here we see two different approaches. **Philip** has already given up and could only say “I do not know”, but **Andrew** attempts to find a solution even in a hopeless situation.
This is how faith functions: one accepts the situation, does whatever little thing is possible to do, and then trusts God to do the rest. And this is what Jesus expects: the disciples should start solving the issue, then bring the issue to Him, so that He can miraculously provide for this need.

6:15: **Make him king**. People wanted Jesus to work 8 hours a day and multiply bread. (Андроник Пантак) 

6:26: **Not because you saw signs, but because you ate your fill**. A “sign” is something that points to something; namely, to the Messiah. The sign of bread in the wilderness pointed to Jesus as the Messiah, but the people did not see that sign. They merely saw a miracle and were attracted by free bread and entertainment. (Андроник Пантак)

6:26-34: (26) Люди смотрят мимо знамений (указывающих на Мессию) и думают лишь о том, что Иисус — источник бесперебойного питания. (27) Иисус говорит людям, которые беспокоятся лишь о хлебе, чтобы они не о батонах думали, а о духовных вещах. (28) Они спрашивают, и как же это делать? (29) Иисус говорит: дело Божье — верить в Того, Кого Он послал. Не о хлебе думать, а о Мессии и спасителе. То есть, обо мне. (30) Евреи поняли намёк, и спрашивают: ну хорошо, а чем ты докажешь, что ты Богом посланный? (31) Вот Моисей, например, сделал так, чтобы хлеб с неба падал. А ты что сделаешь? (32) Иисус объясняет, что не Моисей это сделал, а Бог Отец. И сейчас, прямо сейчас, тот же Отец даёт вам настоящую, духовную пищу. (34) Евреи заинтересовались, но опять же, простыми батонами. (35) Теперь Иисус говорит им в лоб: Я это, я, тот хлеб, который Бог послал с небес. Духовная пища — это я. (Андроник Пантак) 

6:27: **Work**. Jesus calls their attention from mere miracles to the signs. He calls them to **work**, to make effort, to strive for spiritual things rather than physical things.

6:29: **The work is to believe**. Jesus says that this is what they should do: recognize signs as such.

6:30: **What sign.** The Jews may think that they are willing to accept a sign if it’s going to be given, but they have just missed one, being unable to understand and recognize. They even remember the manna episode (v. 31), but are unable to link what had happened with Israel with what has just happened in front of their eyes.

6:40: **Look on the Son**. To see is to have a personal experience, a relation, a contact. (Андроник Пантак)

6:40: **Looks on the Son and believes**. May be a parallel to the serpent raised by Moses in the wilderness: people who looked on it, and believed, were saved from a physical disease. People who look on the Son, and believe, are saved from the spiritual disease.

6:44: **Unless the father draws him**. Now, the sum of the doctrine of eternal security comes down to this.  Is the death of Christ a work that *potentially* saves *willing* sinners, or is it a work that *actually* provides salvation for *unwilling* sinners who by God’s sovereign grace *will be made willing*? The only possible answer is that God provided a sacrifice in His Son, a true payment in full for the sins of *all who would ever believe*, and all who would ever believe will believe because the Father will **draw them**, and He will grant them repentance, and faith, and regeneration. (MacArthur)

6:66: “**From that time many of his disciples went back**,” back where?  Just back, back to their former life, “and walked no more with him.”  Why?  Too much, too much was expected, too much was required.  They weren’t interested in total commitment.  They bailed out.  Free food?  That’s great.  Healing?  Super.  Commitment?  Not interested.  Verse 67, “Jesus said to the 12.”  Listen, after everybody leaves, guess who’s still there?  12 guys.  What I’m trying to show you is: these are not just sort of tagalongs; these 12 are the ones who counted the cost, stuck it out, paid the price when the rest bailed out.  And He said to them, “Will you also go away?”  And you don’t understand that in English you have to see the Greek.  The Greek is a class of condition that should expect a no answer.  In other words Jesus said this, and if you were looking at it in the Greek, “You won’t also go away, will you?”  Peter speaks for the group and says, “Where would we go?  You have the words of eternal life.  And we believe and are sure that you are the Christ, the Son of the living God.”  Then, Jesus points out that even among them, one of them’s a devil.  But the point was this: the crowd was on the surface in the physical; Peter says, we’ve gone past that, we’re looking at a spiritual truth, we see You as the Messiah, the Son of the living God.  You got it, Peter.  (MacArthur)

7:37: **Living water**. The word “**living**” is a verb; literally, a *water that lives*.

8:1: St. Augustine (354-430) knew the passage, and claimed that some men had removed the passage due to a concern that it would be used by their wives as a pretense to commit adultery: "Certain persons of little faith, or rather enemies of the true faith, fearing, I suppose, lest their wives should be given impunity in sinning, removed from their manuscripts the Lord's act of forgiveness toward the adulteress, as if he who had said, Sin no more, had granted permission to sin." (__[Wikipedia](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jesus_and_the_woman_taken_in_adultery&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1582399365475000)__)

8:9: Jesus shamed the woman’s accusers into inaction, but they did not become merciful. (MacArthur)

8:33: Israel’s history was one of repeated conquest and oppression — by Egypt, Assyria, the Medes and Persians, the Greeks, and, finally at that very time, by Rome. Apparently, pride would not allow those Pharisees to even admin it existed. (MacArthur)

?:?: Compared to the synoptic gospels, it may seem that John is trying to make himself a more distinguished disciple than he actually were: he constantly promotes himself a step further than Peter. The episodes that support this point of view: John is at Jesus’ chest and passes Peter’s question (), John lets Peter into the yard (), John outruns Peter (). But John is not inserting himself into a story. He was one of the three apostles that formed Jesus’ inner cirle: Peter, James, and John (Among many other examples: Mk 5:37: Jesus allowed no one else in; Mk 14:33: Jesus took the three to Gethsemane; Mt 17:1 Jesus takes the three to His transfiguration). When Paul visited the apostles in Jerusalem, the three were pillars (Gal 2:9). So, John is only elaborating the facts that, for some reason, were not mentioned in synoptic gospels — of which he, beyond doubt, was informed.

12:6: “**because he was a thief**.”  He didn’t become one here, he always was one.  He was stealing from the thing the whole time, all three years.  He was a thief, and he had the bag, and watch this, and the Greek says: “He pilfered what was put in it.”  Can you imagine that kind of a guy?  Here’s a poor band of people going around doing good, and he was stealing out of their resources, all the while.  He had absolutely no love for them, no affection for them.  The fact that he didn’t know any of them and was from the south, played into the hands of his secrecy very well, they knew nothing about him.  And all the while he was stealing out of the bag. (MacArthur)

13:22: Now, outwardly Judas didn’t appear to have defective character.  I’m sure of that.  In fact, he must have had qualities and capacities which commended him.  Three years, he was with the disciples, and Jesus said in the upper room in, in John 13, He said: “One of you will betray Me.”  And all the Apostles responded.  Do you remember how they responded?  Did they say, “Is it Judas?”  No.  Every one of them said, “Is it I?”  Why?  They had no more reason to suspect Judas then they had reason to suspect themselves.  They knew better about themselves and they assumed better about Judas.  He was a fantastic hypocrite.  He was so good at it, they elected him treasurer of the group.  That’s right.  They gave him the money.  That’s how much they trusted him. (MacArthur)

13:26: **Iscariot**. That is simply a geographical identification.  Why is it that Judas is identified geographically, and the other 11 are not?  It’s important, because he is the only non-Galilean.  He is the only Jew from the southern section.  He is the only Judean Jew.  All of the rest came from Galilee.  And this may indicate to us that from the very beginning, Judas was never really one of the boys.  Also, the southern Jews felt themselves greatly superior to the rural Jews of the north, and would have looked down on them.  And consequently there may have been a certain amount of pride involved which deepened as time went on. (MacArthur)

13:26: He said, “**The one to whom I give the sop, he it is who betrays Me**.”  Sop was a piece of bread that you stuck in a bowl, and in the bowl was a sort of a paste-like jam made out of fruit and nuts.  And you took the bread and just sort of soaked it in that, and it was common in the Orient to honor a guest and the meal, and the one who was the honored guest would be the one to whom the host gave the sop.  The host would dip it and give it to the honored guest.  And He said the one to whom I give the sop, he it is that betrays Me.  And He dipped the sop and gave it to Judas.  And at that very moment He was honoring him, He was respecting him, He was showing love to him. (MacArthur)

13:27: Christ could have transformed Judas, if his heart had been willing.  He was the same raw material; he was no more unqualified than anybody else.  But the same sun that melts the wax, hardens the clay, and while the other men were being melted and molded, he was being hardened. (MacArthur)

13:30: Apparently, Judas was attracted to Jesus, that’s obvious.  He followed Him.  He stayed with Him.  And he stayed with Him longer than a lot of the other false disciples who bailed out much earlier than this.  In fact, in John 6, you remember last week I said that there were many disciples who followed Jesus, but when He demanded total commitment out of them it says, “And many of His disciples walked no more with Him.”  But the 12, it says, remained.  So, even when Jesus called for all-out commitment, even when He said you must eat My flesh and drink My blood, even when He made total demands on them and many of them left, Judas stuck it out.  He stayed.  And so, he was definitely attracted to Jesus.  I don’t think he was particularly attracted by the spiritual, I think he was attracted on the selfish level.  I don’t think it was really Jesus alone that drew him; I think it was what Jesus could do for him that drew him.  He saw the power of Jesus, and he believed that this man would bring the Kingdom.  And he was not interested in the Kingdom for the Kingdom’s sake or for Christ’s sake; he was interested in the Kingdom for what he might gain from it if he were on the inner circle.  So, he’s totally motivated by selfishness.  But nonetheless he followed, in a half-hearted way. (MacArthur)

14:15: W.E. Vine said regarding faith, “It is a firm conviction; it is a personal surrender, and conduct inspired by such surrender.”  And he was commenting on the term pisteu, to believe.  In fact he compares peith and pisteu, closely related etymologically.  The difference in meaning is that the former implies what the latter produces, obedience and faith.  He says, “When a man obeys God, he gives the only possible evidence that in his heart he believes God.”  Did you get that?  “When a man obeys God, he gives the only possible evidence that in his heart he believes God.”  I mean, what good is it for you to stand there and say, “I believe God, I believe God, I believe God; I just don’t care what He says?”  Oh?  He says, “Peith in the New Testament suggests an actual outward result of the inward persuasion and consequence of faith.” 
Faith obeys.  Oh, it doesn’t perfectly obey, does it?  Your faith doesn’t perfectly obey.  It longs to obey, and it does obey, but it doesn’t perfectly obey.  Romans 7, Paul says, “I don’t do what I want to do, and I do what I don’t want to do, and I fight the battle of my flesh.  But the wishing” – I love this in verse 18, Romans 7 – “the wishing is present with me; it wants to obey, it longs to obey, it hungers to obey.”  To believe is to obey. 
(MacArthur)

16:12: **But you cannot bear**: a person can only accept "в меру возраста Христова"

17:4: Jesus said He **has accomplished**, even though He was not crucified yet!

18:10: When **Peter** used his **sword**, he was not trying to **cut off** Malcus’ **ear**; he was going for his head! Peter has just seen that the whole Roman army has fallen flat on the ground. Peter has seen that just the Name of Jesus made the whole army fall, so seeing such power on his side, he wasn't going to fight that servant alone, but he was going to fight the whole army! Peter had a sense of invincibility because he knew who was on his side. (MacArthur)

19:26: We have no idea when Joseph died, but it could have been well before Jesus began His public ministry. Obviously, it was before Jesus' crucifixion, because from the cross Jesus gave His mother into the care of John. (MacArthur)

20:3: **Тотчас вышел Петр и другой ученик**. Пришла женщина (!), одна (!), говорит какие-то странные вещи, но ученики почему-то ей верят.

20:4: **бежал скорее Петра**. То есть, они по дороге не общались. (Андроник Пантак)

20:6: **Множество рыбы**. Иисус совершает перед ними то же чудо, что было совершено при их призвании. (Андроник Пантак)

20:7: **Плат особо свитый**. Некоторые видят этот момент как подтверждение того, что Иисус не размотал пелены, а прошёл сквозь них. Потому что пропитанные бальзамическими средствами пелены невозможно просто снять, не разматывая. (Андроник Пантак)

20:14: **Но не узнала, что это Иисус**. Как же так она могла Его не узнать? Потому что у Христа была способность отводить глаза (Лк 24:16: "их глаза были удержаны"). (Андроник Пантак)

20:14: **Но не узнала, что это Иисус**. Возможно, она так же не узнала Его потому, что она сама стояла в темноте гробницы, а Иисус находился снаружи, и против света было плохо видно. Но как же она тогда не узнала голоса?

20:15: Почему Иисус первым явился женщинам? Чтобы они распространили информацию быстрее, и чтобы все скорее узнали! (Свт. Филарет (Дроздов); цитирует Андроник Пантак)

20:18: **Мария Магдалина идёт и возвещает ученикам**. Это уже второй раз, как она сообщает ученикам странные новости.

20:26: **После восьми дней**. В течение этого времени ученики наверняка многократно обсуждали явление Иисуса. В течение этого времени Иисус так же явился Клеопе и его Спутнику. Фому уже наверняка становилось по-детски обидно за то, что Иисус всем явился, а ему нет. А может, укреплялся в осознании того, что ученики намерены совершить обман. 
И смотрите, Господь целых восемь дней продержал Фому в этом состоянии!
(Андроник Пантак)

20:27: **Подай перст твой сюда**. До сих пор к Иисусу прикасалась только Мария Магдалина. Теперь же, на глазах у всех, к Нему прикасается Фома. Это делается не только для Фомы, но и для того, чтобы впоследствии ни у кого не возникло сомнений, что Иисус был настоящий, а не бестелесный призрак.
Хотя в ст. 20, где *Иисус показал им руки и ноги и рёбра Свои*, тоже могло быть прикосновение, но мы об этом не знаем.
(Андроник Пантак)

20:28: **Господь мой и Бог мой!**. Что интересно, в Библии Свидетелей Иеговы, которые не верят в божество Иисуса, и у которых свой, "правильный" перевод, этот самый стих переведён так же, как и у нас: "Фома ответил ему: «Господь мой и Бог мой!»". С большой буквы. [На русском](https://www.jw.org/ru/%D0%B1%D0%B8%D0%B1%D0%BB%D0%B8%D0%BE%D1%82%D0%B5%D0%BA%D0%B0/%D0%B1%D0%B8%D0%B1%D0%BB%D0%B8%D1%8F/bi12/%D0%BA%D0%BD%D0%B8%D0%B3%D0%B8/%D0%98%D0%BE%D0%B0%D0%BD%D0%BD%D0%B0/20/#v43020028), и [на английском](https://www.jw.org/en/library/bible/nwt/books/john/20/#v43020028) тоже.

21:6: **No fish**. The message is: you are fishermen, yet you have no **fish**; I am not a fisherman, but I do have fish. Хватит заниматься рыбными делами, на своё усмотрение: проповедуйте Евангелие. (sermon)
