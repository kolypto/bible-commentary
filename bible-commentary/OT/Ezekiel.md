## Ezekiel

16: Ezek 16. This is the longest chapter in Ezekiel’s prophecy. There are forty-eight chapters, chapter 16 is the longest. It is the most vivid, it is the most dramatic, and it is the most forceful chapter in Ezekiel and one of the most dramatic in all of Scripture. And what it does is explain to us this unique love that God has for His own. He loves, so He chooses, and He will redeem whom He loves and chooses. It is an incredible chapter.
Now let me give you some warning. It is very graphic. It is very distressing. It presents the nation Israel in such loathsome and sorted terms that rabbis within Judaism through the years have not permitted this chapter to be read in any public meeting. And you can go all the way back to the Mishnah and Rabbi Eleazar ben Hyrcanus and you find there a prohibition against reading this chapter publicly. Why? Because it focuses devastatingly on the iniquitous character of Israel. But the sad part of it is that the chapter is not about Israel’s iniquity, it is about God’s maintaining His love toward a grossly sinful people; and not to read it by saving face disconnects you from the profoundest truth of all Scripture, and that is that God has set His love by His own will upon a certain people, chosen them, and will redeem them.
