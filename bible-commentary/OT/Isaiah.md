## Isaiah

7:14: The **you** here is a plural *you*, indicating that Isaiah was also speaking to the entire nation, telling them that God would not allow anyone to destroy them and the line of David. Be (MacArthur)

7:14: The word **virgin** (almah) is used 5 other times in Scripture, and in each case contains the idea of a virgin. Until recent times, it was always translated as such by both Jewish and Christian scholars. (MacArthur)

7:15-16: Isaiah also refers to another **boy** who would be born. Before that child (Maher-shalal-hash-baz) was **old enough**, the lands of Rezin and Pekah would be **deserted**. Sure enough, before the child born to Isaiah's wife was 3 years old, those two kings were dead. Just as that ancient prophecy of a child came to pass, so did the prophecy of the virgin birth of the Lord Jesus Christ. (MacArthur)
