## 1 Samuel

10:9: God has always been concerned above all else with the inside of man, with the condition of his heart. Until now, Saul had been handsome, athletic, and not much more; but now **God gave him another heart**. But the new king soon began to revert to his old heart patterns; he chose to disobey God and to trust in himself. God tool the kingdom from Saul because he refused to live by the new heart God had given him. (MacArthur)

13:14: God tool the kingdom from Saul because he refused to live by the new heart God had given him. (see note on 10:9). (MacArthur)
