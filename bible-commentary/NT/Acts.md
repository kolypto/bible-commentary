## Acts

2:22-24: The chief actor here is **God**: did **wonders**, had a **plan**, and **raised** Him up.

2:24: **Death** could not **hold** Him because He was without sin. And for the same reason He was **raised**; and we will be raised, if we have His life in us.

2:26: Peter's message was very radical: "you, people, had been waiting for **Christ**, and now when He came, *you* have **crucified** Him". The very people that havd been eagerly waiting, have killed their Messiah.

2:27: The people that gathered there have, surprisingly, accepted the message, and were even **cut to the heart**.

2:38: After an accusing speech, **Peter** immediately offers the solution. And speaks the same message that John the Baptist spoke (Mt 3:2,6), and the very same message that Jesus spoke (Mt 4:17; Mk 1:15).

4:33: **Благодать**: два употребления. 1. Обращённая к неверующим: возможность спасения, открытая дверь, незаслуженный дар. Синоним: возможность прийти. 2. Обращённая к верующим: ситуация для служения, способность это делать, подпитка для веры. Синоним: возможность служить.  Первая церковь, продавая своё имущество, максимально освобождали себя, чтобы воспользоваться этой благодатью. (Сергей МЦЦ)

4:34: They sold all they had to free themselves from the burden in order to use the grace that God was giving them. (Сергей МЦЦ)

4:35: Where did the money go? They were selling their property to form a community, but God was preparing them for chapter 8: a great persecution, where the disciples have been scattered from Jerusalem, and had to go out to preach the gospel to the world. That's where they needed the money. They had not known, but God sees several chapters ahead. (Сергей МЦЦ)

5:12: Only Jewish men could enter the **Solomon's Portico**.

5:16: The apostles did not leave **Jerusalem** for several years. Believers came there three times a year. The apostles had the respect of everyone. The Temple was there. The high priests were there. Jesus was going to return there. And there was not a needy person among them (5:34). Why move anywhere? Everything was going well. It is possible that they were expecting the Kingdom of God to be and to remain in Jerusalem.

5:28: **bring this Man’s blood on us** [by accusing us as His murderers] (AMP)

5:30: Peter is bold enough to tell to their face that they have crucified the Christ. His boldness can be explained by his confidence in God's support: the healings done by his hands, and the recent prison break miracle definite nourished his faith. And importantly, they knew that what they stand for is the truth.

5:34: **Gamaliel**. Gamaliel was so elevated that he was called "the beauty of the law". This means that the law was never so beautiful as when it has been taught by Gamaliel. And this is the teacher who brought up Paul, probably starting at his age of 13. (MacArthur)

5:34: **Gamaliel**. The Talmud says that “since Rabban Gamaliel died, the glory of the Law has ceased.”

5:38: Если дать делу отлежаться, становится ясно я с какими начинаниями оно было затеяно. В церкви тоже, за любую хорошую вещь нужно помолиться, подождать. Если от Бога, то всё получится. (Сергей МЦЦ)

6:3: Why **full of the Spirit**? Because this is not just some sort of mundane unimportant task, but an essential service to God.

6:3: Церковь — это не здание; церковь — это люди, которые в нём собираюсь. Кто отвечает за проблемы в церкви? Прихожане. Здесь апостолы даже не заметили, что существовала такая проблема. Когда к ним пришли и сказали, что проблема есть, они ответили, что не будут этим заниматься; "вы займитесь, а мы будем продолжать служить и проповедовать". И мы, если видим, что что-то не в порядке, нужно брать и решать вопрос самому. (Сергей МЦЦ)

6:7: **Continued to increase** in human hearts, like a growing green sprout. This was happening because people were being sanctified by the **word** being spread, heard, and believed in: "sanctify them in the truth; Your word is truth" (Jn 17:17).

7:25: Moses killed a person, and then **supposed** that **God** acted through him. Was his thinking right, and God would really kill by a hand of a righteous person, this breaking the commandment? Or did it mean that Moses has sinned, and his thinking was wrong, and he had to be disciplined?

9:3: **Suddenly a light from heaven shone aroudn him**. Paul didn't learn *new facts*. Factually he understood who Christ was, he understood the facts of His life, he also understood the facts of the gospel that were being preached by Christians, that's why he persecuted them because he thought it was heresy and he wouldn't have persecuted a heresy that he didn't understand. 
So he understood it. But when he was confronted by Christ, and the Holy Spirit began to illuminate his hard heart and take the shield off of his understanding, he began to consider Christ for the first time.
Please note this. Salvation is a sovereign act of God by which He invades the sinner's darkness, gives him light and saves him. But salvation does not annihilate, obliterate, destroy, or bypass, human faculties. It stimulates human faculties. 
Now Paul considers all that he had "rubbish" (Php 3:8). For years his salvation had been built on ritual, his race, rank, tradition, religion, sincerety, and works. And then he met Christ and saw that it was all loss. A liability he gladly gave up for the sake of Christ.
(MacArthur)

9:9: **For three days he ... neither ate nor drank**. What did he do? He communed with his new Master.
The last thing he had seen before he went blind was the blazing presence of the glory of Jesus.  That sight dominated his now sightless eyes.  It was a blindness that I would think was not the blindness of blackness, but the blindness of light.  Not the blindness of looking into the darkness of a pitch black night, but the blindness of looking into the brilliance of a blazing sun.
Great guilt weighed him down.  He had a lot to think about for three days, didn’t he?  He knew nothing about his future.  He didn’t know who he was anymore.  He didn’t know what he was supposed to do.  This was total devastation of everything he was, and it was in those days that all that he had considered precious became rubbish.
Salvation was sudden, but its depth are often plumbed slowly.  He is now stunned; he is helpless; he is friendless.  He has friends who are now enemies, and enemies who don’t know they’re to be friends.  For three days, he communed with his Lord.
(MacArthur)

9:36: Interestingly, the girls name **Tabitha** sounds like the words that Jesus had said in order to raise another dead girl in Mk 5:41

11:23: The **grace of God** that Barnabas has witnessed was not just a number of people that have performed a ritual. He was so impressed because the report (v.22) was true: “a great number has turned to the Lord” (v.21), as evidenced by “repentance that leads to life" (v.18). What he has seen were changed lives.

11:26: Город Антиохия был разделён на четыре части стенами, и люди из разных частей мало общались друг с другом. Церковь объединяла не только людей из разных частей города, но и людей из разных сословий, у которых не было ничего общего, кроме Христа. Именно поэтому их стали называть Христианами. (МЦЦ, Мелешко)

13:3: **They** have not only **sent** the chosen two, but also decided to add more people to the group: at least John Mark, who would leave later (v. 13)

13:4: **Cyprus** is where Barnabas was born and raised. Perhaps, this is why he had been chosen by the **Spirit** for this journey? (Acts 4:36)

13:6: At this point, they have already crossed the whole island on foot: some 200km. 

15:1: Вопрос стоит более широко, как видно из 5-го стиха: соблюдать ли весь закон Моисеев. И вопрос этот не о церковных традициях, а о спасении. Фарисеи пытались отстоять, что соблюдение закона нужно для спасения. 

15:10: Фарисеи в ст. 5 говорят "надо исполнять"; и ведь наверняка они уверены, что исполняют исправно. А тут Пётр их выговаривает: да вы же сами его исполнить не можете; зачем на других вешаете?!

15:11: Пётр объясняет, что соблюдение ритуального закона не помогает и не мешает спасению, потому что спасение по благодати.

15:20: Обратите внимание: смесь морального и ритуального закона. Это два набора, указанных в письме по двум разным причинам. Моральный закон, естественно, обязателен для любого верующего; апостолы подчеркнули два пункта, наиболее актуальных для язычников. В особенности блуд, широко среди них распространённый.

15:21: Моральный закон действует; однако из ритуального же закона апостолы (в Духе святом: ст.28) выбрали только несколько моментов, которые представляли для евреев самую мерзость: кровь, идодожертвенное, удавленина. Чтобы не оскорблять евреев, которых много вокруг "по всем городам", были даны эти повеления; иначе с ними можно хорошо поссориться и оттолкнуть их от веры — из-за куска мяса.

15:39: Варнава поручился за Павла, когда тот впервые пришёл к апостолам. (?:?)

15:37: Варнава — сын утешения; он видит людей, он в своё время увидел Павла и поручился за него; теперь он увидел что-то в Иоанне. Павел же человек дела, он идёт за призом, и ушедший Иоанн для него как предатель. И вот у них конфликт — не богословского толка, а конфликт характеров. Богу нужен любой характер; люди же в разногласиях должны стараться не согрешить. Вовремя остановиться. (Лунёв)

16:6: Paul was undoubtedly traveling on the Via Sebaste: a Roman military road. Paved with stones. (__[Images in Google](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.google.com/search?tbm%3Disch%26q%3Dvia%2Bsebaste&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1582399365480000)__)

16:6-7: Ever since leaving **Galatia**, they have only received negative answers from the **Holy Spirit**. Paul and his people have travelled some 250km before they reached **Troas** and **the Spirit** has told them what to do. (__[Map: Paul’s second missionary journey](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://cdn.neverthirsty.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/pauls-second-missionary-journey.jpg&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1582399365480000)__)

16:12: **Philippi**. Philippi was the first Macedonian city in which Paul witnessed. That makes it the first Christian sermon in Europe (!)

16:12: **Philippi**. In Greece, a center of culture.
In Philippi. was a major city northwest of the nearby island, Thasos. Philippi was a Roman colony: the most privileged status for provincial cities. 
In 356 BC, King Philip II of Macedon conquered the city and renamed it to Philippi. aimed to take control of the neighbouring gold mines and to establish a garrison at a strategic passage: the site controlled the route between Amphipolis and Neapolis, part of the great royal route. The Via Egnatia, an important Roman commercial road linking Italy and the east, passed through Philippi (see “Via Egnatia”). 2000 people lived there.
Philip drained nearby marshes, greatly expanding a small existing settlement on the slope of a prominent hill. He added a theater, city walls, and gates and named the resulting urban center after himself. 
Following the assassination of Julius Caesar in 44 BC, the conspirators (Brutus) fled Italy and gathered their troops near Philippi for a climactic battle, which they lost against Mark Antony and Octavian (later named Augustus by the Senate). After the victory at the battle of Philippi in 42 BC, Antony settled army veterans in the city.The city was enlarged by a colony of Rom. veterans after the war.
Its status as an Augustan colony exempted Philippi from significant forms of taxation and also granted additional privileges of land ownership. The colonists held the full legal status of citizens of Italy. Philippi’s legal and judicial systems were Roman, and Latin was the official language of civic rule. 
The Roman ethos of the colony is evident in Philippi’s Latin civic inscriptions and worship of Roman gods. According to one study, of 421 inscriptions recovered from Philippi, only 60 were written in Greek. 
One of the temples in the Philippian forum was devoted to the imperial cult from the time of Augustus. 
The relatively small (50-by-100-m) first-century forum was linked to two small temples, a library, and administrative buildings. These buildings would have been the likeliest places for Paul’s confrontation with the city’s administrators (Acts 16:19). One small stone crypt (built over a cistern) near the forum was designated in later church tradition as the prison site of Paul and Silas (Acts 16:23–34). A theater,  Sanctuaries to the Egyptian gods.
(Wikipedia)

16:16: **Place of prayer** (lit. **going to the prayer**). Not a house, because a house would've been called oikos proseuchēs (Mk 11:17: ‘My house shall be called a house of prayer for all the nations’? But you have made it a den of robbers.”)

16:16: **Place of prayer**. Philippi seems to have had no significant Jewish population. No traces of a synagogue have been found in the city. (It has been suggested that a third-century-AD tombstone indicates the existence of a synagogue at that time, but its location is unknown). 
When Paul first visited Philippi, he went outside the city to find the open-air place of Jewish prayer. Paul's first convert is a non-Jewish woman; no men are mentioned at that gathering, which may explain why no evidence of a synagogue exists in the first century: since Jewish law required at least 10 men in order to form a synagogue.

16:16: **A spirit of divination** (lit. **A spirit of Python**). In Greek mythology, Python was a large female dragon who guarded the oracle at Delphi until being slain by Apollo. It was killed by Apollo, who then received the surname Pythius. 
Their battle is depicted on Greek sculptures, vase paintings, and coins. The place of Apollo’s triumph became known as Pytho and was considered to be the center of the earth. The priestess of the oracle, whose sanctuary is an important archaeological site today, was known as the Pythia.
In Hellenistic belief, the **Python** was a spirit of divination that possessed certain persons and made them prophesy, unconsciously and usually with the mouth closed. The term pythōn later came to designate someone with powers of fortune-telling.
This has no connection with the genus of giant snakes to which this Greek name is given.
(Internet)

16:19: **Crying out**. The words of the fortune-telling girl (v. 17) were true in a formal sense. Paul was greatly annoyed, probably because he did not want it to appear that she was his partner in the gospel. (ESV)

16:25: **Other prisoners** were definitely surprised to see imprisoned people in such a good spirit.

16:25: **Hymns**. Those songs were praising God.

16:26: Two or three miracles are described here. The first is **the earthquake**. The second is the **opening of all the doors**, because no earthquake can open all the doors without ruining the walls. The third one is **the unfastening of everyone’s bonds**, because again, no earthquake can undo any shackles.

16:28: **harm **(Gk. *kakos*: something bad, in the widest sense. This word is usually used in the NT for sinful things)

16:29: **fell down**. In Acts 10:25, where Cornelius fell down before Peter, he said “Stand up; I too am a man.”. Paul does not rebuke **the jailer**. 
However, when the jailer calls Paul **Sir** (Gk. *Kyrios*, Lord) in v.30, Paul immediately corrects him: “belive in the **Lord** (*Kyrios*) Jesus” (v. 31). In v.32, it is again, “word of the Lord” (*Kyrios*). This may indicate that something has changed in the heart of the jailer: Jesus has become his Lord.

16:32-34: There is a peculiar movement going on here. In v. 32, Paul preached **to his house**, which means that the whole family is there somehow. In v. 33, the jailer **took them** and **washed their wounds**, which means Paul is in the jailer’s house. He is then **baptized**. And in v. 34 the jailer **brings** Paul **into his house **again.
Did they go to the house twice? Probably yes, because **baptism** did not take place at the house; it took place in a river.

16:33-34: What indications of the **jailer**’s repentance do we have? The fruit of repentance, as John the Baptist said, is the indication: the actions of the person. The actions of the jailer: **he took them** (to the house, probably), he **washed their wounds**, he **was baptized**, **brought them up into his house**, **set food before them**, **rejoiced**, **had believed in God**.

16:37: **Пусть придут и сами выведут нас.** Это не гордость, а репутация, о которой беспокоится Павел. Их уже принародно били: то есть, люди подумали, что их дело — это что-то нехорошее. А потом эти люди ещё и втихаря пропали бы: значит взяточка была. А Павел понимает, что в этом городе, в отличие от Иерусалима, он может настаивать на своих правах, и он мастерски пользуется этой возможностью во благо дела Божия. 
Значит ли этот пример, что нужно всегда отстаивать свои права? Павел отстаивал их не ради себя, но ради Евангелия. (Лунёв, МЦЦ)

19:12: **Два года**. Придя в город, предполагал ли Павел, что останется здесь на два года? Какую цель он себе ставил? Как он планировал?
Очевидно, он не ставил своей целью пробыть там сколько-то времени, или приобрести какое-то определённое количество учеников. Нет, Павел не ставил себе количественных целей. Его целью был сам процесс: "проповедовать Евангелие". Результат принадлежит Богу. (Лунёв)

24:26: **Paul** spent two years in prison, knowing, that a bribe would set him free, yet never gave it!

26:14: A **goad** is a spiked stick used for driving animals. When an animal pressed against it, it hurts itself.

28:3: **Vipers** (*echidna*) were small but very poisonous desert snakes. When still, they looked like a dead branch and were often picked up unintentionally. This is exactly what Paul did. (MacArthur)
