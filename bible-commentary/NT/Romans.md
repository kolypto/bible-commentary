## Romans

1:1: The good news (**the gospel**) is in that Jesus has conquered the grave, conquered sin, and by His death has given us the power to defeat sin in ourselves. Because of the ressurection we can be saved. (Byron Johnson, UA)

1:7: **Grace**. It means a favor bestowed by God through His power to transform a person’s life, starting at salvation and going on from there.
Grace is a dynamic force, a dynamic and benevolent power, that applies the goodness of God and the resources of God to our lives, to save us, to keep us, to enable us, to deliver us, to sanctify us, to glorify us. All of God’s good favors to His children are given through the means of this beneficent goodness called grace..
(MacArhur)

1:18: **Неправда человеков**. Павел проповедует Евангелие именно потому, что оно спасает от всего того, что описано далее: нисходящая спираль греха. (Лунёв)

1:24: **Предал их Бог в похотях**. Павел говорит, что для людей, которые ведут себя подобным образом, Бог стирает границы, убирает упрёк Духа Святого, и позволяет людям скатиться ко всё худшим вещам. Люди, считавшие себя мудрыми, считавшими что у них всё под контролем, придут к помутнению рассудка, и будут скатываться всё ниже. (Лунёв)

2:1: **Судящий другого**. Только что Павел описал грешников, а теперь предупреждает: не осуждайте их, потому что сами такие же. (Лунёв)

2:15: **Закон написан у них в сердцах**. Написан Богом. С теми людьми, до которых не дошли человеческие проповедники, Бог работает напрямую через сердце и совесть, и не оставляет их погибать. Бог может обойтись без человеческой помощи, даже в деле спасения. (Лунёв)

3:18: **There is no fear of God**. "Fearing God" is a synonym for being a true believer, a God-fearer: a man who has respect for God’s holy person, work, Word, and will. It is not the idea of flight or panic or dread, but reverential respect, a sense of awe. When you've accepted God as God, your character has changed, and now you have a new motive which affects all of your behavior and speech.
By the way, the OT is filled with the concept of fearing God on a negative side. God wanted people to be afraid of Him. That’s why He turned Lot’s wife to a pillar of salt; drowned the world; sent snakes to bite the Israelites; swallowed Korah, Dathan, and Abiram; killed Nadab and Abihu; sent fire down from heaven at the call of Elijah; consumed a hundred soldiers. God wanted to be feared as a judge. 
There is to be a healthy fear of the power of God and of His judgment. But it’s not only that. Fearing God is revering His holiness, honoring Him for His mercy and grace, giving Him glory. 
(MacArthur)

3:18: **There is no fear of God before their eyes**. At the root of man’s problem of sin and unrighteousness is a practical atheism: he does not fear God. All the previous evils, all the indictments rise out of the absence of that fear. He is motivated by a wrong attitude toward God. (MacArthur)

3:19: An average person, when asked, will definitely say he thinks that he is a good person. we tend to think this way only because we compare ourselves with others. But if we compare ourselves with the God's law, **every mouth **is** closed**. (John Strohman)

3:21: The **righteousness of Christ** does not mean we will automatically have practical righteousness. It means that now we are able to be righteous in practice coma and previously we were not. (MacArthur)

4:25: Jesus was the ultimate sacrifice for our sins. After His crucifixion, according to Talmud, God has ceased to accept the sacrifice that was done in the Temple: “The Rabbis taught that forty years prior to the destruction of the Temple the lot [‘For the Lord’] did not come up in the [high priest’s] right hand nor did the tongue of scarlet wool become white…” (Talmud, Tractate Yoma 39b). The Temple was destroyed in 70 A.D., and 30 A.D. is the year when Jesus was crucified. During these 40 years that priests were continuing their service, other signs were observed. The menorah (lamp of presence: signified presence of the Lord in their midst), every night for forty years, went out, and this in spite of the priests each evening preparing in a special way the western lamp so that it would remain constantly burning all night! “...become white; nor did the western most light shine [(the menorah)]; and the doors of the Hekel [Temple] would open by themselves” (Soncino version, Yoma 39b).

7:7: Sin cannot be overcome without the grace of God, so the law was given to convert the soul by anxiety about its guilt, so that it might be ready to receive grace (St. Augustine)

8:16: — I don't know, can't explain it, but I just feel (in my spirit) that something has changed and I'm a different person now. (Dr. Stanley)

9:7-8: Paul explains that although Ishmael was the firstborn child and should have been the heir, it was Isaac who had inherited God’s promise. Because a true child of Abraham is not one who was biologically born, but the one whom God has promised to be His child. In the following v. 11 Paul explains that this happens by election, not by any human work.

12:2: **Renewing of your mind**. What should be going on in our minds?  What should be going on in the deepest recesses of our minds and hearts?  What should be happening there?  I’ll tell you what, worship and love to God.  Worship and love to God.  When we were saved we were saved to be true worshipers.  The Lord saved us in order that we might be made true worshipers.  Listen to this: to sin in the mind, then, is to desecrate the very sanctuary where our highest and best worship should be taking place.  So, cultivating sins of the mind not only defiles the mind, but it displaces worship for which we were saved.  And there again, it can be defined as a form of blasphemy. (MacArhur)

12:2: **Discern the will of God**. I believe we can know God’s will.  Let me tell you why. A very basic thought: God does not will things for us that He does not make available to us. If God has a will for my life, then He will reveal it to me if I’m in the right place to receive it. God does not purposely frustrate Himself. God wills that men be saved.
