## 1 Thessalonians

2:3: Paul emphasizes that despite them been *shamefully treated in Phillipi (v. 2),*Â they suffered for their honest service to God, not for deceitfulness.

5:17: If you do something wrong, the time to repent and regret is not in the evening, but right there, in the moment. Whenever you catch yourself doing or even thinking the wrong thing, repent right away, and dad to God in **pray**er: please, forgive me, change my heart, help me do better. Inviting God j to daily situations will ultimately help us change!
