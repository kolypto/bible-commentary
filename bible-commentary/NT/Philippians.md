## Philippians

2:7: Jesus trusted His Father. When He was incarnate, when he took up humanity, he was willing to **give up** His **equality** to God: he ceased to exercise some of His divine qualities. For instance, by a willing ristriction of His omniscience, He did not even know when the second coming would occur! He limited Himself only to what His Father willed. Consequently, in those self-imposed limitations, He had to entrust Himself to God, because He did not at that time know everything that could be known. Consequently, He had to operate in the mode of trust.  (MacArthur)

3:8: **Rubbish**. What Paul considers to be rubbish, is actually some heavy-duty religious credentials. This **rubbish** is not vice, or going against God; it is actually *a religion*. Rubbish of trying to please God with self effort and religious works. It counts for nothing.
Most of the people in the world believe they will attain eternal life by accumulating religious credits. The only people who don't are Christians, the rest do. They are deceived.
And that is particularly true among Jews because there is Old Testament precedent for their religion. And so they believe that the credits impress God and He will grant them salvation. Paul says not so, it is  worthless. Because I have discovered, he says, in my encounter with the living Christ that salvation is by grace through faith. It has nothing to do with heritage or human effort. It has all to do with Christ.
People in religions pray certain prayers. Go to temples. Very sincere in their heart, wanting to do what is right.
God is not impressed. Salvation is not by ritual, race, rank, tradition. Salvation does not come by sincerity. You can have a lot of zeal and be absolutely wrong, and Paul says, "I thought it was right, I considered it garbage when I met Christ."
Every person in the world is in one of those two categories. When you meet Christ, you either drop all the stuff that you've been counting on for your salvation and take Christ alone, or you hold to all the stuff you've been holding on to for your salvation and turn your back on Christ. Those two categories, you're in one of them, everyone is. That's it.
What are you counting on, who are you counting on for your salvation? You're either trusting yourself and your achievements, or Christ. And when you come to trust Christ, all the achievements become rubbish. That's the exchange.

3:8: **Rubbish**. Paul didn't say "I had something good, this is better." He said, "This is complete loss". Not an asset. That's not neutral; that's negative! 
Wait, is it bad to be circumcised the eighth day? Bad to be a Jew? Bad to be of the tribe of Benjamin? Bad to be a Hebrew of the Hebrews? Bad to be religious? Bad to be zealous? Yes in this sense, if you count on that to save you. Because it is so self-deceiving. 
You know the hardest person to reach in the world for Christ is the person who is religious. And the more religious they are, and the more sincere they are, and the more stuck in tradition they are, and the more ceremonial they are, the harder they are to reach. Why? Because all their confidence is in that stuff and consequently they count on that for their salvation. 
Paul says that is not just good and this is better, that is bad. Why? Because religion damns the soul. False religion deceives the mind and damns the soul.

3:8: **Knowing Christ**. He uses the word gnosis, which does not mean to know something intellectually; it means to know someone personally, by personal experience. So Christians are those who know Christ personally. (MacArthur)

3:8: **Gain Christ**. What do we gain in Christ?
The knowledge of Christ. Theologians call that identification. 
We gain the righteousness of Christ. Theologians call that justification. 
We gain the power of Christ. Theologians call that sanctification. 
We gain the suffering with Christ. Theologians call that participation. 
And we gain the glory of Christ. And we all call that glorification. 
That's the pearl, that's the treasure. The wise people sell all to make it theirs.
(MacArthur)

4:6: We simply do not realize how much time and trouble we would be saving ourselves by praying about matters instead of running around trying to handle them by our own efforts (John Strohman)
