## 1 Timothy

1:2: On **mercy** and **grace**, see Mt 5:7.

1:15: The main goal of a preacher is to humble the **sinners**. And he must understand that the **foremost** sinner the preacher himself, and it is he who needs the gospel the most. The other goal is to exalt our Savior, Jesus Christ, Who came to **save the sinners**. (J.T. Дом Отца)

2:4: **would have all men to be saved**. Some think that this verse means that everybody will be saved, but if it said that, why is there hell? Why is the Bible full of warnings? Why didn't Jesus just come and declare a happy future for everyone?
So then it means something else. Then there are things that God desires, and they don't come to pass. He desires them, but He allows them to be otherwise. He allows for some not to be saved. This is hard for usto understand, but it must be what it means. Only the elect are saved.
(MacArthur)

2:15: **she will be saved**. Saved from what? Not from sin, because salvation is by grace alone. Saved from the curse of Gen 3. 
A woman gives birth to children who are genetically inclined to sin. She can be delivered from this curse by raising godly children, **if they continue in faith**.
Because mothers have a unique bond and intimacy with their children, and spend far more time with them than fathers do, they have far greater influence in their lives and thus a unique responsibility and opportunity for rearing godly children. While a woman may have led the human race into sin, women have the privilege of leading many out of sin to godliness.
(MacArthur)

5:1: Like a **thief **— only for those that have rejected Him, and for whom Jesus is not welcome. Believers would gladly accept Him.
