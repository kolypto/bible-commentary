## 1 Peter

2:9: The rest of the chapters, as well as the next chapter, are dedicated to proper Christian behavior. Therefore, Peter means that** proclaiming** **the excellencies** of God is achieved by the conduct of a person. Have a look at 3:1, where an unbelieving husband "may be won without a word, by the conduct of their believing wives".

2:11: Now Peter is saying, “This is **war**, and unless you get yourself committed to righteousness — ” and by that I don’t mean you never sin; I mean that there is a decreasing frequency of it; and when you do, you confess it, you repent of it, and you turn from it. You deal with it before God. You are honest enough to evaluate your life. 
He is saying, “I beseech you, abstain from fleshly lusts, for they are warring against your soul.” When you fall to them you lose, and there goes joy, and there goes fruitfulness, and there goes reward, and there goes ultimately God’s honor in the face of the world.
That’s the negative. “Abstain from fleshly lusts.” The positive is in verse 12. “Having your behavior honest among the Gentiles.” Be committed. Live a righteousness life. Live a life above reproach. (MacArthur)

2:13: **For the Lord's sake**. Wait a minute, *for the Lord's sake*, not for the government's sake??! Why? Because people are evaluating the legitimacy of your faith on the basis of your citizenship. (MacArthur)

2:13: **Be subject**. How far does it go? Obey to the point where the government violates a direct command of the word of God, where you'd stand on Acts 4 & 5:  “At this point we will obey God and not man.”. That's where we draw the line. (MacArthur)

3:1: **In the same way**: like the government (2:13), like the master (2:18), even those that are unreasonable. Wives that do this are pleasing to the Lord, and are under His protection. Even when it's difficult, and you are afraid of where the husband would lead you. Be like Sarah: the prototype of the submissive, who called her husband "Lord's. (MacArthur)
