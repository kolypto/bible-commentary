## Ephesians

1:7: “**In Him we have redemption through His blood**.”  He redeemed us.  What does it mean to redeem?  To buy back.  What did He do to buy us?  Well, we were slaves to sin.  We were slaves to death, and hell, and Satan, and demons.  We were slave to the fallen flesh.  We were slave to the world.  And there we were in the slave market.  And He came to the slave market and He bought us.  Worthless, wretched, vile, rotten, darkened, hopeless, with minds that could never know God, and hearts that could never seek righteousness, and all our desire was lust and evil, and we were unworthy, and He came and bought us.  Why?  Because He chose us.  Because He predestined us.  Because He was wanting to grace us with grace.  You say, “Why did He want to do that?”  I don’t know.  He just did.  That was His will, that was His purpose, that was His good pleasure.
**Forgiveness**, aphimi, to send away never to return.  He removed our sins as far as the East is from the West.  He buried them in the depths of the sea.  He remembers them no more.  No wonder Micah says, “Who is a pardoning God like You?”  Paul says, “There is therefore now no condemnation to those who are in Christ.”  Ephesians 4:32, Colossians 2:13 says, “We are forgiven.”  First John 2:12, “My little children, He has forgiven all your sins for His namesake.”  How could He do that?  Through His grace, through the riches of His grace, which He lavished on us.  It took a lot of grace, a lot of grace because we had a lot of sin.  In fact, according to the parable of Matthew 18, we have an unpayable debt, almost an uncountable debt, an indescribable debt.  To whom do you owe your salvation?  You owe it to the God who chose you.  You owe it to the God who predestined you.  You owe it to the God who redeemed you, the God who forgave you, the God who wanted you to be His own.  Because He wanted you to be His own; it doesn’t give any other reason, even though we’re so unworthy.  So unworthy. (MacArthur)

1:13: Notice, **He sealed us**. Verse 13, “In Him you also after listening to the message of the truth, the gospel of your salvation having also believed, you were sealed in Him with the Holy Spirit of promise who is given as a pledge or a guarantee of our inheritance, with a view looking forward to the redemption of God’s own possession,” that’s us, “to the praise of His glory.”  He sealed us.  Sealing something in ancient times was a sign of ownership, a sign of security, a sign of authenticity and a sign of a completed transaction.  When we were saved, He sealed us.  How?  Gave us His Spirit.  The Holy Spirit dwelling in a believer is a sign that God owns that believer, a sign that that believer is secure, a sign that that believer is authentic, a sign that that believer has received the completed transaction.  He secures us, authenticates us, completes us, and owns us, we are His own possession.  Verse 14 says: and the indwelling Spirit is the guarantee that someday we’ll experience the fullness of what that means.  Marvelous.  We wait for the full redemption, Romans 8 says, but we’re sealed until that day. (MacArthur)

2:10: **Good works**. No person is saved *by* good works, but every believer is saved *for* good works. (MacArthur)

5:22: The prerequisites start in v. 19: have a joyful spirit; v. 20: be thankful, even for the trials (because they come from God and have a perfecting work); v.21: have an attitude of mutual submission, in which you consider others better than yourselves. These are the spiritual prerequisites for a successful marriage. (MacArthur)

5:22: Sarah called her husband "**Lord**" (1 Pet 3:6). (MacArthur)

5:23: It is the leadership of care, in a context of love. (MacArthur)

5:25: It is the **love** of self-sacrifice, not the love of domination (MacArthur)

5:25: It was revolutionary in a society where males had control over the female population, which were considered less than human, with no rights at all. Paul says you have to exchange that for a self-sacrificing, humble, unselfish love. (MacArthur).

5:25: It is a command from the Lord to love your wife. You can't say "I don't love her anymore" without admitting that you have sinned. Christ loved sinners when they hated Him, that's the standard. (MacArthur)

5:25: A husband should love his wife not for what she can do for him, but for what he can do for her. Like **Christ** loved the church, not for anything we could do or were. Swallow your personal desires, put everything aside — because that boils down to temptation. Sacrifice yourself, living a spirit-led life. (MacArthur)

5:26: If you really **love** your wife, you got to hate everything that defiles her. Anything that steals her purity will become to you a terrifying enemy. Any so-called love the drags the partner down to uncleanness is a false love. You are to live your wife in such a way that you look toward her godliness. Love always seeks the absolute purity of its subject. And seeks it's sacrificially. It may mean confrontation, it may mean a certain discipline, but it's certainly means you protect her from temptation and that you expose her to the purifying influence of God's truth. (Jn 17:17: "Sanctify them by the truth; your word is truth"). (MacArthur)

5:25-27: This love is a sacrificial love (v. 25), a cleansing love (v. 27), a caring love (v. 28).

5:28: The essence is meeting needs, being concerned to fulfill each requirement with great devotion. We are called to treat our wives with the same preoccupation we give to ourselves. If she has a need, or a secret longing, a reasonable dream, we are to look to fulfil it. We are to nourish her, so that she, in her marvellous role, can nourish the children. (MacArthur)

5:29: "**to nourish**" literally means "to warm with body heat", like a mother bird warms her children. (MacArthur)

5:31: After you've married, you became one body  Therefore, if you want to be a happy husband, you have a happy wife. If you want to be a fulfilled husband, you'll have a fulfilled wife. You want a real happiness in your marriage, then treat her as you treat yourself. (MacArthur)

5:31: This is such a union that is a oneness of the flesh. This physical union goes beyond that, but it starts with a physical relationship. You become one person, co-mingled with your life partner. (MacArthur)

5:31: An advice for the young people: pick carefully, it's for life! What's the key to picking wisely? Simple. Be filled with the Spirit, walking in a godly way, so that your mind is tuned to the will of God. That's why when young couples come in for counselling before getting married, the first thing we ask them is: are you involved with each other physically? Because if they are, they're in a sinful condition, and people in a sinful condition cannot discern the will of God! So you have to separate and live a godly life to be able to understand the mind of the Spirit, then you'll know! I always tell the young people: don't worry about finding the right person, worry about *being* the right person! And if you are the right person, then the person God has for you will recognize you. Now, what would you look for? First, find out someone's reputation. (Pr 22:1: "a good name is better than riches"). Second, try to avoid a reclamation project and wait until the spirit of God has done that. The idea of marriage is not so that you can lead her to Christ. Thirdly. "Favor is deceitful, beauty is vain, but a woman who fears the Lord, she should be praised". Find someone who worships the Lord from the heart. Look for reputation, look for a worshipping heart. Listen to what they say, because "out of the abundance of the heart the mouth speaks". What's the conversation like? What kind of people do they run with? Shallow people, deep people, godly people? (1 Cor 15:33: "evil company corrupts good morals"). And check out their wardrobe! Really? Absolutely! Because "godly women are not so much concerned with the adornment of the body as they are with the inward adornment". And when they do call attention to themselves, they call attention to their virtue. (MacArthur)

5:32: Like **Christ** loves the **church**? That's an unbreakable love that just keeps forgiving and never becomes embittered. Can man cast off his wife? I'll answer that question with a question: can Christ cast off His church? (MacArthur)

5:33: What is it, most importantly, that causes relationships to be sustained over a long haul? In a word, it is forgiveness. No matter who you're married to, they're going to fail you. They're going to offend you. They're going to misunderstand you. They're going to misinterpret what you mean by what you do. You are going to offend them. You are going to sin against them. You are going to disappoint them. This is true in any kind of relationship -- because we are sinful creatures, we are fallen creatures. In you marriage you are headed to major disaster if you continually accumulate hostility because of offenses, if you continually allow this bitterness to develop. But whenever there is an immediate forgiveness, it's disappearing, it's gone. That's the key to any relationship. And what essentially keeps that from destroying relationships is fogiveness. 
In fact, in Prov 19:11 it says "it is man's glory to overlook a transgression". Never is a man more lofty or more noble than when he forgives. Our society sees that as weakness, but unforgiveness is a very severe thing: it imprisons people in the past, produces deep bitterness, distort how you see life. But *forgiveness is the most godlike act that a person can do*! No act is more like God than forgiveness, never are you more like Him than when you forgive someone who has offended you! It is a promise of undeserved, unearned love that affirms to the offender that there is no hatred, no anger, no desire for vengeance, no retaliation, because guilt and blame has been removed, there is no self-pity and there is no bitterness. 
And that is precisely the attitude of God towards sinners that He grants to us in Scripture. "Forgive each other, just as God in Christ forgiven you; be imitators of God". Eph 4:32-5:1. Also Col 3:13. Moreover, if we don't forgive, God will not forgive us (Mt 6:15) and will "turn us over to tormentors" (Mt 18:34-35). It is chastening, serious chastening, torturers, tormentors! Might be stress, hardship, illness, difficulty. James 2:13 says the same thing: "judgment will be merciless to the one that shows no mercy". But "blessed are the merciful" (Mt 5:7) (MacArthur)

5:33: (Перевод) Есть ли что-то такое самое главное, что позволяет сохранять взаимоотношения людей на долгое время? Одним словом, это "прощение". На ком бы вы ни были женаты, этот человек подведёт вас. Он обязательно оскорбит вас. Он будет неправильно вас понимать. Он вообще будет ошибочно расценивать ваши поступки. И вы обязательно согрешите против любимого человека. Вы его разочаруете. Так случается в любых отношениях -- потому что мы грешные и падшие существа. И нужно понимать, что если вы постоянно копите злость и обиду, если вы позволяете копиться горечи.. то ваш брак находится на пути к полной катастрофе. Но если во взаимоотношениях проявляется немедленное прощение, то вся горечь пропадает: её больше просто нет! Это и есть ключ к любым взаимоотношениям. Самое главное, что способно удержать отношения от разрушения это прощение.
В книге Притчей Соломоновых даже сказано, что "слава человека – оставить обиду без внимания". Ни в какой другой ситуации человек не является более возвышенным, чем когда он прощает. Наше общество часто видит это как слабость, но на деле, держать обиду - это очень суровая вещь: она заключает людей в тюрьму прошлого, творит сильную горечь на душе, и искажает ваш взгляд на жизнь. Но прощение - это самое богоподобное действие, которое человек способен совершить! Вдумайтесь: ни один другой поступок не соответствует Богу так, как прощение, и никогда мы не близки к образу Бога так, как когда мы прощаем того, кто нас обидел! Прощение - это обещание незаслуженной любви которая уверяет оскорбившего в том, что в нас нет места ненависти, злобе, или желанию к отмщению, потому что вина была стёрта; без жалости к себе нет места и горечи.
Именно такое отношение проявляет Бог к грешникам к Писании: "прощайте друг друга, как и Бог во Христе простил вас; подражайте Богу" (Еф 4:32-5:1). Более того, если вы не прощаете, Бог так же не простит вас (Мф 6:15) и "отдаст его истязателям" (Мф 18:34-35). Это заставляет задуматься: "истязатели"! Они могут прийти к нам в виде стресса, трудностей, болезни, тягостей. Иаков 2:13 говорит то же самое: "Ибо суд без милости не оказавшему милости". Но "Блаженны милосердные" (Мф 5:7). (МакАртур)

6:14: (__the armor of God__) The first three items (“**the belt of truth**”, “**the breastplate of righteousness**”, “**the shoes… readiness… gospel of peace**”) is something that a believer should have on all the time, because that’s what the Scripture says: v. 14: “having fastened”, v.14,15: “having put on”. In v. 16, however, Paul says “**take up**”, means that this is something that you only use when necessary, when the flaming arrows start to fly, and you **take it up **in addition to what you already have. 
**The shield of faith**, whatever it is, is sufficient first of all because with it you can **extinguish** not some, but **all** of **the fiery arrows**. What are those fiery darts? Those were arrows whose heads were soaked in pitch, which would burn rather slowly but rather hotly. Paul is simply referring to templations: the devil is literally bombards the believer with the arrows, the fiery darts of seductive temptation, to elicit out of us ungodly, non-Christlike, evil responses. And the only defense, Paul says, is the shield of faith. (MacArthur)

6:13: The important thing in Christian life is not to chase the devil, not to bind him, control him, or expel him, but simply to **stand**. Stand where we are and not budge. Stand. (~MacArthur)

6:14: Four times Paul says that the most important duty of a Christian is to **stand**. Before doing anything else, simply **stand** on what you've learned, and **withstand **every attempt of the enemy to move you. Do not budge or move; **stand**! (MacArthur)

6:15: The **shoes **were not a fashion item, but the means to protect your feet. The best warrior out there with the best armor would be absolutely immobilized and debilitated if he hurts his feet. Roman soldiers had leather shoes with thick soles so that they could firmly stand on any surface, rocky or flat, slippery or not, and this firm foundation let the soldier fight a good fight without stumbling or slipping. 
Here Paul says that this thick and firm foundation is the **Gospel**: the very thing that every Christian stands on and the thing that guarantees his stability. The gospel lets the Christian stand firm. (MacArthur)

6:15: Many interpreters hold that this verse is speaking about preaching the **gospel**, but this is not what Paul speak about here. The **gospel** gives firmness of footing to give solid ground in the battle, but this firmness is not for going, but for standing! This verse does not speak about going around and preaching the gospel; it speaks about standing firm and fighting the devil! Paul makes it clear in vv. 13 and 14. Because of the gospel we don’t slip, we don’t slide, we don’t fall when under attack. (MacArthur)

6:15: The solution to confronting satan is the word of God. What shatters satan's power, what unmasks him and devastates him is the word of God. And we see that modeled in the temptations of Jesus, where Satan comes to Him with three temptations, and every single time Jesus quotes scripture to him and vanquishes him by quoting scripture in the face of that confrontation. (MacArthur)

6:15: This **peace** that Paul talks about is the peace that has reconciled the fallen and sinful man to the holy God by the means of the gospel: the sacrifice of His Son. The gospel is in that man was at war with God, but God made **peace**. And this peace gives **readiness** — literally meaning. being equipped, having foundation and firm footing — because when I know I am at peace with God, when I know that God is on my side, I can have the devil throw at me whatever he wants, and I can be confident that I will stand firm. Because God is on my side. (MacArthur)

6:17: **The helmet of salvation**. The helmet of salvation serves the purpose of deflecting blows from heavy swords all the enemy. Sin no longer has dominion over you, that's what salvation means. 
A believer has been saved once, and he's being continually cleansed from all unrighteousness: in the past, we have been saved from the penalty of sin; in the present, we are being saved from the power of sin; and in the future, we will be saved from the presence of sim. Salvation has happened, is happening, and will happen. Justification, sanctification, glorification. (MacArthur)

6:17: The **word** here is not *logos* — the general word of God, meaning the whole of the Bible; the word is *rhēma*: an utterance, by implication, a matter or topic. **The sword** is not just the Bible as a whole; **the sword** is a specific teaching, a specific utterance, which applies to a specific situation you’re facing. (MacArthur)

6:17: The term, “**Word**,” here is not *logos*. *Logos* is a term meaning word that speaks of a broad or general reference. The Word of God, the general idea. It is the word *rhēma* (an utterance, by implication, a matter or topic), and it means a specific statement. It isn’t talking about a broad knowledge. It’s talking about a specific statement. **The sword of the Spirit** is the specific statement of God. A specific teaching, a specific utterance, which applies to a specific situation you’re facing.
And if you don’t know what God specifically says about that temptation, you can’t deal with it.  So that you must learn to know the total of the Word of God so that you know the specifics.  That’s why when I teach you the Bible I don’t just read you the Scripture, tell three stories, and send you away.  What I try to do is teach you the principles in the text.  Because the principle is the specific statement that God wants you to understand so you can put it in your reservoir to use against Satan. (MacArthur)

6:17: H. P. Barker was a master of illustrations.  One day he described himself looking out a window and watching a garden full of plants and flowers.  And he said, “I saw three things” in the garden.  “First, I saw a butterfly.  The butterfly was beautiful, and it would alight on a flower and then it would flutter to another flower and then it would flutter to another flower.  Only for a second or two would it sit and it would move on and it would touch as many lovely blossoms as it could, but derived absolutely no benefit from it.  Then” – he said – “I watched a little longer out my window and there came a botanist.  And the botanist had a big notebook under his arm and a great big magnifying glass.  The botanist would lean over a certain flower and he would look for a long time and then he would write notes in his notebook.  He was there for hours writing notes, closed them, stuck them under his arm, tucked his magnifying glass in his pocket, walked away.”  And then he said, “The third thing I noticed was a bee, just a little bee.  But the bee would light on a flower and it would sink down deep into the flower and it would extract all the pollen that it could carry.  It went in empty every time and came out full. 
And H. P. Barker said, “So it is with people who approach the Bible.  There are those who just flutter from lovely sermon to lovely sermon, from class to class, fluttering here, fluttering there, bringing nothing, and gaining nothing.  What a nice feeling.  Then there are the spiritual botanists who take copious notes who are trying to make sure that all the vowel pointings are correct but they don’t have the capacity to draw anything out of the flowers; it's pure academics.  Then there are the spiritual bees who draw out of every precious flower all that is there to make the honey that makes them so blessed to those around them.”  Which are you?  You can come to Grace Church and be a butterfly.  You can flit from class to class, Bible study to Bible study, seminar to seminar, book to book, flipping your little pretty wings, never changing.  Or you can be a botanist.  Some of you have enough notebooks to sink a small battleship.  Or you can be a bee coming in empty and going out full and turning it into the honey that makes life sweet.  Which are you?  The sword is there, it’s available.  Are you using it?
