## Ruth

**Goel** (the Go’el HaDahm) is a Hebrew term which comes from the word lig'ol ("to redeem"), hence meaning "redeemer", which in the Hebrew Bible and the rabbinical tradition denotes a person who as the nearest relative of another is charged with the duty of restoring the rights of another and avenging his wrongs. The obligations of the goel include the duty to redeem the relative from slavery, if the latter had been obliged to sell himself into serfdom (Lev 25:48-49); to repurchase the property of a relative who had had to sell it because of poverty; to avenge the blood of his relative; to marry his brother's widow in order to have a son for his brother, in case the brother had not got any son to pass his name forth (Dt 25:5-6); and to receive the restitution if the injured relative had died (Numbers 5:8).

**Main themes**: obedience, faithfulness, kindness, praising God.

In **Jewish Bible** (__[Masoteric tradition; not other traditions](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ketuvim&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1582399365239000)__), this book is placed after proverbs. So, you read about Ruth after reading Pr 31, which speaks about a godly wife, a woman who fears the Lord. "Charm is deceitful, and beauty is vain, but a woman who fears the Lord is to be praised.

(Pr 31:30). The portrait of an idealized woman is made into a real person.

1:2: Ahimelech might have had some wealth (4:3: owned a parcel of land). Perhaps, they ran away from famine to a better land; or perhaps, they ran away so that they did not have to feed the poor. He and his sons have died. And unlike any other section of this book, God is never mentioned here. There may have been a disobedience.

1:2: Ironically, **Ephrath **means "fruitful".

1:4: The whole nation of **Moab** started with incest (Lot's daughters; Gen ?:?). They hired a prophet to curse Israel (?:?). Their beautiful women seduced Israel's men, and 25 000 men died (?:?). But God had a believing person coming even from a nation like that.

1:4: Mahlon, who married **Ruth**, did so in violation of the Mosaic Law (Dt 7:3: "You shall not intermarry with them"; although the verse speaks about Caananites), and she had no right to marry an Israelite. Many Jewish writers say his early death, and that of his brother, were a divine judgment on their disobedience. (MacArthur)

1:5: The family was going to be wiped out from the face of the Earth, but God graciously saved the line. The line through which Jesus Christ was going to come. *Yahweh saves* is the main message of the book.

1:20: **Naomi** is filled with pain, sorrow, and bitterness. But in ch. 4 it has changed.

3:1: The harvest is over (2:23), and Ruth had no reason to see Boaz anymore. But Naomi had a plan.

3:7: Boaz was drunk, but Ruth was righteous, unlike her ancestors, daughters of Lot.

4:6: The redemption of the land would involve the spending of money, drawn away from the Goel’s own estate; but the land thus acquired would not belong to the Goel himself, but to the son he should have by Ruth, who would yet be, in the eyes of the law, the son of Mahlon. (Elliott's Commentary)
