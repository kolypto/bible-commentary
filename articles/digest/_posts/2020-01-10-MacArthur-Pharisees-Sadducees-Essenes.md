title: MacArhur: Pharisees, Sadducees, Essenes
---
First of all, the Pharisees.  Now here you go.  The Pharisees believed that happiness was found in tradition or legalism.  They were hot on the past, big on the past, real big.  They believed that real happiness came through obeying the traditions of the fathers.

Then there were the Sadducees.  And the Sadducees believed that happiness was found in the present, modernism, liberalism.  Can the past, man, we’re here.  We’ve got to do it now.  An updated religion, brand new liberalism, chuck the old stuff.  You know, in a sense, they both had a little tiny bit of truth.  The Pharisees were right.  True religion has to be based on the past.  The Sadducees had a little bit of truth because true religion has also got to work in the present.

And then there were the Essenes.  And the Essenes said, “Nope.  Happiness is in separation from the world.”  Oh, it sounds good, doesn’t it?  Only they were talking about geographical separation.  They just moved out of town.  Years ago there was an ad in a Christian magazine put in by one of our very, very fundamental Christian colleges that said the school was located 15 miles from the nearest sin.  Just offhand, I’d say that’s wishful thinking.  But the Essenes believed we got to get out of town, where there’s no sin.

So there were the Pharisees, the Sadducees, the Essenes, and then there were the Zealots.  And Zealots said happiness is found in the political overthrow.  Happiness is found in revolution.  Happiness is found in knocking off Rome.

So, you see, the Pharisees were saying, “Go back.”  And the Sadducees were saying, “Go ahead.”  The Essenes were saying, “Go out.”  And the Zealots were saying, “Go against.”  And the Pharisees were the nostalgia buffs.  And the Sadducees were the modernists.  They were buying Danish furniture.  And the Essenes were the isolationists.  They were stashed up in a monastery somewhere.  And the Zealots were the socalled religious, social activist.  What a mess.  Sounds just exactly like 1978 to me.

We’ve got religionists living in the past.  We’ve got liberals trying to invent a new religion for the present.  We’ve got people who think holy living is an issue of geography and they just want to make sure that they don’t ever go near anything that looks like sin.  And then we’ve got the people who think religion is a matter of leading a parade and a march on somewhere.

Jesus was confronting a whole society full of religionists.  They all had their own little thing going.  And the point that Jesus was making is, “Hey, you know, you're all wrong, every one of you.”  For the Pharisees he was saying, “Religion is not a matter of external observance.”  And for the Sadducee he was saying, “Religion is not a matter of human philosophy invented to accommodate the new day.”  And to the Essenes he was saying, “Believe Me, religion is not a matter of geographical location.”  And to the Zealots he was saying, “And neither is religion a matter of social activism.”

What he was saying is this, “My kingdom is inside.”  Do you see?  It’s inside.  That’s the whole point.  That’s the whole message of Jesus to the world.  That’s the whole basis of the Sermon on the Mount.  It’s inside, not outside.  Not outside rituals, not outside philosophy, not outside location or monasteries or any of that stuff, not outside activism, it's inside.

What Jesus is saying right here, I believe, is cracking open the door on the new covenant of which Jeremiah said, “God would write His law on their inward parts.”  Do you see?  Going inside.  And so Jesus summed it up by saying to them, “Look, the Pharisees, the Sadducees, the Essenes, the Zealots, and everybody who was either a conglomerate of all of that or stood underneath those four areas, I want to tell you all something, unless your righteousness exceeds that kind of righteousness you will, in no case, enter my kingdom.”  Do you see?

“Unless you’ve got more going for you than that external stuff, you’ve got no part of my kingdom, because as I’ve said before there is no source of blessing in the cursed earth.  It’s beyond that.  All that religion was dealing with externals and the Sermon on the Mount invades Jewish thinking with a blast that true blessedness comes from the inside, not the outside.

The same is true today.  Don’t comfort yourself in the fact that you’ve got the right theology.  The liberals can’t comfort themselves in the fact that they’ve spun off this great new theory, or the Bible is not the word of God, they’ve really updated it.  Boy, they’re really contemporary.  They’re flowing with the age.

A man cannot comfort himself in the fact that he’s moved away from the world and moved up into a monastery and he sits there and contemplates God, undistracted by the things of the world.  Nor can a man comfort himself because he thinks he’s a social activist and he’s running around all over the place trying to straighten out society.  Those are not the things Jesus is after.

Oh, ultimately, all those things have a corner on a part of the truth, don’t they?  We need to be socially involved, and we need to be set apart unto God, and we need to be contemporary, and we need to be based on the past, but in and of themselves they’re external, and God is after what’s inside.
