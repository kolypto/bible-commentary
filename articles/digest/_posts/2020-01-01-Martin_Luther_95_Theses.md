`1.`  When our Lord and Master Jesus Christ said, ``Repent'' (Mt 4:17), he willed the entire life of believers to be one of repentance.

`2.`  This word cannot be understood as referring to the sacrament of penance, that is, confession and satisfaction, as administered by the clergy.

`3.`  Yet it does not mean solely inner repentance; such inner repentance is worthless unless it produces various outward mortification of the flesh.

`4.`  The penalty of sin remains as long as the hatred of self (that is, true inner repentance), namely till our entrance into the kingdom of heaven.

`5.`  The pope neither desires nor is able to remit any penalties except those imposed by his own authority or that of the canons.

`6.`  The pope cannot remit any guilt, except by declaring and showing that it has been remitted by God; or, to be sure, by remitting guilt in cases reserved to his judgment. If his right to grant remission in these cases were disregarded, the guilt would certainly remain unforgiven.

`7.`  God remits guilt to no one unless at the same time he humbles him in all things and makes him submissive to the vicar, the priest.

`26.` The pope does very well when he grants remission to souls in purgatory, not by the power of the keys, which he does not have, but by way of intercession for them.

`27.` They preach only human doctrines who say that as soon as the money clinks into the money chest, the soul flies out of purgatory.

`28.` It is certain that when money clinks in the money chest, greed and avarice can be increased; but when the church intercedes, the result is in the hands of God alone.

`30.` No one is sure of the integrity of his own contrition, much less of having received plenary remission.

`35.` They who teach that contrition is not necessary on the part of those who intend to buy souls out of purgatory or to buy confessional privileges preach unchristian doctrine.

`45.` Christians are to be taught that he who sees a needy man and passes him by, yet gives his money for indulgences, does not buy papal indulgences but God's wrath.

`53.` They are the enemies of Christ and the pope who forbid altogether the preaching of the Word of God in some churches in order that indulgences may be preached in others.

`62.`  The true treasure of the church is the most holy gospel of the glory and grace of God.

`63.` But this treasure is naturally most odious, for it makes the first to be last (Mt. 20:16).

`64.` On the other hand, the treasure of indulgences is naturally most acceptable, for it makes the last to be first.

`65.` Therefore the treasures of the gospel are nets with which one formerly fished for men of wealth.

`66.` The treasures of indulgences are nets with which one now fishes for the wealth of men

`75.` To consider papal indulgences so great that they could absolve a man even if he had done the impossible and had violated the mother of God is madness.

`76.` We say on the contrary that papal indulgences cannot remove the very least of venial sins as far as guilt is concerned.

`86.` Again, ``Why does not the pope, whose wealth is today greater than the wealth of the richest Crassus, build this one basilica of St. Peter with his own money rather than with the money of poor believers?''

`91.` If, therefore, indulgences were preached according to the spirit and intention of the pope, all these doubts would be readily resolved. Indeed, they would not exist.

`92.` Away, then, with all those prophets who say to the people of Christ, ``Peace, peace,'' and there is no peace! (Jer 6:14)

`93.` Blessed be all those prophets who say to the people of Christ, ``Cross, cross,'' and there is no cross!

`94.` Christians should be exhorted to be diligent in following Christ, their Head, through penalties, death and hell.

`95.` And thus be confident of entering into heaven through many tribulations rather than through the false security of peace (Acts 14:22).
