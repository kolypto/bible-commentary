title: John MacArthur How to discern God’s will?

How to discern God's will? If you're choosing a job, or a place to move to, or a girl to marry?

1. For you to be saved. Salvation is basic, because the natural man would not understand the things of God (1 Cor 2:14).
2. For you to be Spirit filled (Eph 5:18: "be filled with the Spirit"). Not just to have the Spirit resident, but to have the Spirit *dominant*. The word "filled" is used to speak of total control (Examples: Jn 16:6: filled with sorrow; Lk 4:28: filled with wrath; Lk 5:26: filled with fear). To be filled with the Spirit is to have constant Christ consciousness: to stand in His presence constantly and let it dominate your mind.
3. For you to be sanctified. "For this is the will of God, your sanctification" (1 Thess 4:3). "Sanctified" means being set apart. That means being pure, being holy, being righteous, being virtuous, being sinless.
4. Be submissive. "Be subject for the Lord's sake to every human institution" (1 Pet 2:13). Wait a minute, *for the Lord's sake*, not for the government's sake??! Why? Because people are evaluating the legitimacy of your faith on the basis of your citizenship. We also are to submit to our emmployer as unto the Lord (Eph 6:5: "obey your earthly masters"). We have to learn to submit. Also in a marriage. We submit by cooperating; not by allowing dictatorship and tyranny.
5. To suffer. Gods will is suffering. God’s will is that when we confront the world and they react to our message and our life that we may suffer. That's part of the growing of a mature believer. It’s the purging of John 15, where the Word of God, and trials and circumstances strip off the succor branches that retard our growth and dissipate our energy. God has called us to suffering. We do not relish that, but we are willing to bear it. And it gets scary at times.

So, what's the will of God for you?

• If you're not saved, it's for you to be saved.
• If you're not led by the Spirit, His will is for you to live a life where you are led by the Spirit.
• If you're not sanctified, it is for you to reject sin and strive for holiness.
• If you're not submissive, it is for you to become submissive unto His will and His righteousness.
• And if you're not ready to suffer, it is for you to be ready to follow God even if it means suffering.

You say, “Well, MacArthur, you’re a big help. I mean I drove down here in the rain to hear this stuff. All you’re telling me is a bunch of Bible stuff. You don’t tell me which one of those 6 girls I’m supposed to pick. You didn’t tell me where I’m supposed to move, or go to school, or change my job, or how I solve my problem. I feel cheated. I didn’t get a straight answer.”

I got one for you. You’re going to like this. You know, if you’re saved, Spirit filled, sanctified, submissive, suffering and saying thanks you know what God’s will is for you? *Whatever you want*. Do it.  Whatever you want. If you’re saved, Spirit filled, sanctified, submissive, and suffering, and saying thanks, who do you think is controlling your desires?

God is. That's why Ps 37:4 says: “Delight in the Lord, and He will give you the desires of your heart.” And it doesn’t mean He’ll fulfill the ones that you’ve generated, it means He’ll put them there.

I don’t know a better way for God to lead my life than through my desires.  But there’s a trap there, and that is if your desires are not His desires, and they cannot be His desires unless they are on these terms.

There’s a second thought here.  Once you begin to follow that desire in your heart, and if it isn’t clear yet, wait, it will be. When we want to do something, and we follow that desire, then we have to allow God to apply circumstances to that desire that may alter it. But at least it gets us moving.  You can’t steer a truck that’s standing still.  Right?  It’s very difficult.  Once it gets rolling, it’s easy.
