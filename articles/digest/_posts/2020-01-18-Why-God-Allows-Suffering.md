title: MacArchur. Why does God allow so much suffering?
---

I have been assigned an easy question to answer. I don't know how I’m going to fill the time.

Why does God allow evil and suffering in the world? Agnostics often use this question to explain why they cannot possibly believe.
This is called “the problem of evil”. The biblical God is wise. The biblical God is all-powerful. Massive evil exists in the world, therefore the biblical God does not exist.

Now, many see this as such a serious dilemma that a Christian can only give up, change the subject, or snap back with Deuteronomy 29:29, “The secret things belong to the Lord,” kick that as far as you can into enemy territory. Is that the best that we can do when pressed against our theological end zone? Absolutely not. There is an answer in the Bible with which we will score a touchdown.

Not only an answer that you can understand, but an answer that you can joyfully accept.

And it’s not one of the inadequate short answers like, “Well, God’s not responsible. Adam and Eve are,” which only poses the question as to why God made them capable of making those kinds of choices? That doesn’t help.

Well, you say, well, God’s not responsible, the devil is, which only then poses the question, Why did God create an angel capable of going against Him? And why does God let him act? So, that doesn’t help.

You can’t stop asking this question at Adam, or satan. If you’re asking such questions, you’re going to wind up in heaven. A proper answer would lead us back to God.

Now, let’s get theological. Because it’s a theological issue before us.

First point. *Evil exists*. Can anyone doubt that? It exists massively. It exists in a dominating way in our world. In a dominating way. And there are several categories of evil.

Natural evil, that is, calamity. Diseases, disasters, catastrophes, from tidal waves to tiny bacteria. It is a part of the creation itself, in its fallen condition. It is impersonal. It is external to us. Romans 8 tells us about this: “The whole creation groans”.

Also there is moral evil. It is personal, internal, spiritual. Wickedness, sin, transgression. This dominates the human race. It’s in every single human heart and is a dominating and controlling force.
The Bible says, “There’s not one who’s good, no not one”.
“All the thoughts of the heart are only evil continually.” Man is driven by lusts that produce sin and death. All these immoral sinners trying to survive in a fallen world, colliding with each other in malfunctioning marriages and families and friendships and rivalries that escalate into wars, are manifest evidence of the moral evil in the world.

And there is supernatural evil. A force of demonic beings that are as old as their creation. They are evil spirits, liars and deceivers. And 1 John 5:20 says, “The whole world lies in the lap of their leader and their system”. They use their powers to seduce and deceive humanity and to fight the purposes of God. They infect our lives. God sometimes even allows that, as we learn from Job and from Peter and from Paul, who was given a messenger of Satan to buffet him to keep him humble. They have a delegated sovereignty in the world.
They are primarily involved in the development of false religious systems. They are the purveyors of doctrines of demons. Boy, are they sophisticated.

So in the end, evil is not just present. It is pervasive. It is subtle. It is powerful. It is dominant. It is outside of us. It is in us. It is around us. So, we start with the obvious. Evil exists.

Second point. *God exists*. Evil exists, and God exists. The God that the Scripture reveals, because Scripture is His self-revelation. And Scripture tells us that He is the only God, and that He is absolutely sovereign.
By this I means that He is in charge of absolutely everything. He created everything. He controls everything. There’s not one molecule in the universe that’s out of line with His purposes.

If you're having trouble accepting the sovereignty of God, then think awhile on the idea that He’s not in charge. How do you like that? I’m so glad that He is in charge.

Now, if you read the book of Genesis, you will see both points: God is sovereign, and He allows evil. Read about the Flood: “All the thoughts of the heart are only evil continually”, and so God drowned millions of people. Millions. Took responsibility for that.
Some liberal theologians try to rescue God from this perception, but God is quite consent to make it clear that He is, in fact, unhesitatingly sovereign over everything that exists, without a hint of reluctance.
But don't be mistaken. He is holy. He cannot do evil. He cannot look upon evil positively. He is the God who is incapable of doing anything evil. But he is content to leave the responsibility for evil’s existence and even its action, with Himself.

First Samuel 2:6-8, “The Lord kills and makes alive. He brings down to the grave and brings up. The Lord makes poor and He makes rich. He brings low and lifts up, for the pillars of the earth are the Lord’s, and He has set the world on them.”
Or, Amos 3:6, “If there is a calamity in a city, will not the Lord have done it?”
Isaiah 45:5. “I am the Lord, there is no other; the one forming light and creating darkness, causing well-being and creating calamity. I am the Lord who does all these.”

Here is God taking full responsibility for the existence of evil, since He is God and controls everything. Evil is no disruption in God’s purpose.

So, comes to a third point. Evil exists. Sovereign God exists.
Inescapable, is the third point. *God wills evil to exist*.

This makes some theologians panic because they can’t let God be held responsible for evil. They’d rather say that God cannot stop it than He would not stop it. That would be a diminished God, unable to act. That’s a warped view of God.

But alright, if God allowed evil to exist… Why?

Metaphysical system says that evil is an inevitable reality, a corollary of good. It isn’t created by God, they would like to say. No, it just exists. It has to exist because ying has to have yang. For every plus, there has to be a minus.
There is some truth in this: evil is not of God, but evil represents rebellion against what God created and who God is. But it does not answer the question: why?

The most popular answer is the “free will” argument. Free will is more important to God than disallowing evil. God prized human autonomy, and to protect human autonomy he had to allow evil.
But then again, that’s not an answer. If God knew they would have free will and make stupid choices, he made them capable of doing that?

So… why does He permit evil to exist?

If you answer this question right, my friend, it will take you to heights of worship that you would never be able to experience if you don't answer it correctly, because you have a diminished God.

I’m not here to be the first person to give you the answer. This is what the Westminster Confession says: ““All that God decrees and providentially brings to pass, is all to the praise of his glory. Therefore, the existence of evil is, in the end, to the praise of his glory.”

The reason God ordained evil is for His own glory. Simple question. Is God made more glorious because evil exists, or is He made less glorious because evil exists? I will tell you this. God is made infinitely more glorious because evil exists. We praise Him because of what He has done to overcome evil. We praise God for what He does in this fallen world!

Turn to Romans 3:5, if you will. “Our unrighteousness demonstrates the righteousness of God.”  Our unrighteousness – our sin, our falleness, our inequity, our corruption, our wretchedness - puts the righteousness of God on display.

In Romans 5:8, he says that “God demonstrates His love toward us in that while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us.”
God has sacrificed His Own Son, put our sins onto Him, because He is eager and willing to forgive the sinner. And God made a provision for that. Sacrificed Himself for us. And through this we see how loving and gracious and merciful God is.

It’s not just One Person dying on the cross. It was God Himself, an infinite being, bearing the infinite sin of everyone who believed in him throughout human history. A burden of all the sinners of all the world who end up in hell, on an infinite Person with an infinite capacity to absorb an infinite punishment. A redemptive act of our Savior. This puts the righteousness of God on display. We would never see the majesty of that righteousness if we didn't see the cross. We’d never see the cross if there were no sin. So, for the demonstrating of His righteousness, He would allow sin.

God puts His righteousness on display by the way He confronts and deals with sin.

Also look at Romans 9. Just a couple of comments. Verse 22, “What if God, although willing to demonstrate His wrath, and to make His power known, endured with much patience vessels of wrath prepared for destruction? And He did so in order that He might make known the riches of His glory upon vessels of mercy, which He prepared beforehand for glory.”
We wouldn't know what wrath was, and we wouldn't know what mercy was if there were no sin.

All of this lets us realize the righteousness of God.
The Pharisees of the Jesus’ time thought that the righteousness of God was attainable to them. In other words, they think God is less righteous than He is, and they are more righteous than they are, and so they can earn acceptance with God. They can meet His standard.
You never will understand how righteous God is until you go to the cross. And you will see there that as loving and gracious and merciful as God is, as eager and willing as He is to forgive the sinner, He still has to carry out infinite punishment on a substitute to deal with His righteousness.

Let God be God and worship Him for the sovereign that He is, unfolding the glory of His own nature through wrath and mercy, which necessitate evil. This is our God.
