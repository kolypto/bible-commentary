## Revelation

2:13: Nimrod, a grandson of Ham, founded the great cities of Babel: Erech, Accad, Calneh, and Nineveh (Gen 10:10-11). It was at Babel that the first organized system of idolatry began with the tower built there. Nimrod's wife, Semiramis, became the first high priestess of idolatry, and Babylon became the fountainhead of all evil systems of religion. When Babylon was destroyed, the pagan high priest at that time fled to **Pergamum**, and then to Rome. The city of Pergamum is called the **throne of satan**. (MacArthur)

3:20: The imagery here is that Jesus is **knocking** at the **door** *of a Church,* not the door of a human heart! (MacArthur)
