## Ezra

8:21: **Fast**. The most beautiful indication of a fast out of fear. **“I proclaimed a fast there, at the river of Ahava,”** -- They were leaving Babylon and we stopped and we had a fast. Why? – **“that we might afflict ourselves”** – that’s what a fast does. It is self-denial, self-affliction – **“before our God,”** – Why? – **“to seek of him a right way for us,”** – We're carrying a mass of people and we didn’t know the right path – **“and for our little ones,”** – that our children could cross that dessert, that our children would be safe – **“and for all our substance"**. Why?
Because they were brigands and highwaymen and robbers and thieves and wild nomads and enemies and those who hated Israel. And so, they were fearful.

8:22: **Ashamed**. Ezra says, "I didn’t want to ask the king". Why? I love this. – **“because we told him already the hand of God is upon all them for good who seek Him. But His power and His wrath are against all them who forsake Him.”**
I told the king God will protect the righteous. We’re going to be all right king. And now as I get out here, I’m a little afraid. I can’t go back and say, hey, king, I know God is on our side, but could you give Him a little assistance, because that would be a discredit to the character of God. And so, I cannot depend on the king even though he’s somewhat sympathetic. I will depend on God. And in fear it says in 23, “we fasted and we besought our God for this.” You see? One of the reasons for fasting is seeking protection. Again, a time of fear, anxiety, where fasting was very much a response that could be understood.
