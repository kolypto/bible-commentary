## James

1:2: (__how to tell a temptation from a __test) The word in Greek for "**temptation**" and for "**test**" is the same word. Everything is potentially a temptation, and a test. I've always looked at it this way. If you've rejected a temptation then it's a test. If you've succumbed to a temptation, it is then a temptation to which you fell. 
If you're going through a difficulty and you get angry at God, this is a temptation to which you've fell; on the other hand, if you stay strong and realize that the thing you're going through is a test to make you strong, that God is putting you through something that's going to be a blessing to you — if you realize that, then it was a test that you passed. The outcome is what determines what it was. So it's basically the same thing. 
I think you can't go through life trying to figure out whether something is good or evil in itself: just about anything that comes your way could be good or evil depending on how you react to it. The worst possible suffering might come into your life and tempt you to curse God might be a test that will prove the faithfulness and solidarity of your faith. Everything has the potential of being a temptation or a test — depending on how the believer responds to it.

1:2: MacArthur; “How God Uses Suffering”
Now, the question is what does God accomplish in the life of His own through suffering? Why did God allow this? We would assume today that if that ever happens, that’s the devil; that’s satan; that’s demons operating on their own and against the will of God. But not in this case and not always. God is allowing this to happen. Why? And I’m going to give you five reasons why God allows suffering in your life and mine. Five reasons. And they are formidable, practical, powerful reasons. And I really believe they will become an anchor for your soul in trouble.
Number one, God uses suffering to reveal our spiritual condition. God uses suffering to reveal our spiritual character. You really do not know the truth about someone spiritually when everything is going well. Right? It doesn’t surface, because, basically, they appear to be at peace, and happy, and with a measure of joy and satisfaction and fulfillment in life because superficially and on the surface everything’s okay. 
Then when things begin to go wrong, reality begins to surface as to their spiritual condition. And the worse things get, the more their spiritual character is unbared. When you strip away the blessings, and you strip away the successes, and you strip away the prosperity, and you strip away the health, and you begin to peel it all back, then you’re going to find out what somebody is really made of spiritually. 
When you go through the sufferings of life, God has a purpose. His purpose is to manifest the character of your spiritual life to everybody around you, and to you as well. His purpose is to humble you because of his multitude of blessings poured out upon you, and his purpose is to draw you into the intimacy of his glorious presence. 
Number two, God uses suffering to humble us. God uses suffering to humble us. And listen, folks, if need be, he’ll use Satan to do it.
Number three. God uses suffering to draw us to himself. God uses suffering to draw us to himself. Look what Paul did when he was sent "a thorn in the flesh, a messenger from satan" (2 Cor 12:7). Where did he go? To the Lord. Don’t you think that might have been the purpose – or one of the purposes? That’s the right response. He didn’t go to Timothy or Titus; he didn’t go to some of his buddies; he didn’t go to his friends; he didn’t go to somebody with an earthly formula; he didn’t find a therapy to fix his pain. He didn’t look for a technique; he wasn’t after human wisdom. He went to the Lord. 
You know, I think this is the – this is the very special thing that happens in suffering. He was immediately forced into the presence of God, and that’s the best place you could ever be, isn’t it? 
And have you noticed how good times don’t do that? And the severer the trouble, the more likely you are to have an increase in your prayer life. Is that not true? When they take your little baby into the hospital, and they tell you it could die, you get real serious about your prayer life. When you find out your teenager’s on drugs, you get real serious about your prayer life. When you find out your life partner has cancer, you get real serious about our prayers. When you find out you’re on the brink of your business going down the proverbial drain, and everything you’ve put into it, your life savings is potentially to be lost, your prayer life takes another level. Well, I think sometimes that’s what God has in mind.
Point number four, God uses suffering to display His grace. Remember what God said to Paul pleading to remove the thorn that was torturing him? Paul went three times, and three times he got the same answer. “Paul, I hear you. I know you’re asking for the thorn to be removed. I know you’re asking for the messenger of Satan to be removed. I understand all of that. I’m sorry, however; I’m not going to do that. I’m just going to turn up the grace.” Standing answer.
God answers not by removing the pain, because the pain was productive; not by removing the trouble, because the trouble was productive. It really showed the true man, and it humbled him, and it drew him to God. And so, God says, “I’m not going to remove that; the process isn’t over. But what I am going to do is increase the grace so that you can endure it.” He gave relief. God gave relief not by removal, but by sufficient strength to persevere through the necessary humbling process.
In 1 Timothy 1:14, Paul says, “The grace of our Lord was more than abundant.” Wow, more than abundant. Now, folks, get this, would you please? Here is the cornerstone of Christian living. Here is the cornerstone of Christian living; it is simply this – listen carefully – you will have trouble. In this life, it is inevitable, and it is useful because it produces the evidence of your true spiritual condition, humility, and intimacy with God, and allows God to put Himself on display in His grace. This is the cornerstone of Christian living, folks: you will have trouble. God does not promise to remove it, but he does promise to pour out enough grace to endure it.
See, that is the – that’s the current contemporary lie, that God wants your life to be happy and peaceful and comfortable and successful and satisfactory and prosperous. And it’s the Devil who wants all the bad stuff.
You want to know the truth? It’s the Devil who would like to make your life prosperous and successful and happy and tranquil, because then you wouldn’t need God, and you wouldn’t need have to thank Him for anything.
The prosperity message is the Devil’s message. God’s message is a message of suffering and grace. God wants us humble, and He uses suffering to humble us. God wants us intimate with Him, and He uses suffering to make us intimate with Him. And God wants our testimony made manifest; He wants our character on display, and He uses suffering to reveal it. And the greatest testimonies the Christian ever have in history is when they’re persecuted. And the persecution of the saints, the blood of the martyrs becomes a seed of the Church. God will crank up the grace in your life, and He’ll crank up enough grace for you to be able to endure.
And you’ll find yourself singing at the strangest places and times. And you’ll find a peace in your hear that knows no explanation, and you’ll find a joy that’s disconnected from your circumstances because this grace is an energy that transforms. It’s not in itself a static gift. Grace is an energy that changes you. It’s an energy of being flooded with blessing from God that altars your thinking. It changes you, transforms you.
Yes, Paul was in his deepest suffering, but God was using it to put His grace on display. And that turns you into a worshipper, doesn’t it? And God wants you to worship Him. And you couldn’t fully worship Him, you wouldn’t know the abandonment of joy and the abandonment of heart that Paul and Silas knew in the jail, unless you had sufficient grace in the midst of dire suffering. The people who worship God most deeply are those who have been through the deepest water and who have been flooded by His grace.
One last point, God uses suffering to perfect His power. God uses suffering to perfect His power. God wanted Paul not just to be a humble man, not just to be a man of prayer and intimacy with God. Paul was not only to be a man of suffering so that God could display His grace, but God wanted this man to be powerful. God wanted this man to be used to change the world. God wanted him to impact individuals, and families, and cities, and nations.
You see, when the Christian gets to the place where he’s lost all human ability to deal with his difficulty, he’s got nowhere to go. Nowhere to go when you realize you’re weak, when you realize you can’t fix it. You see, when your – when your human wisdom’s out, when our human confidence is out, when your human ingenuity is out, when your solutions to the problems are out, when you have nowhere to go and nowhere to turn but God, you are now in a position to be most effective. I’ll put it this way, no one in the kingdom of God is too weak to be powerful, but many are too strong. Many are too strong. You see, physical suffering, mental anguish, disappointment, unfulfillment, failure creates a pressure that produces power. It really does, because it just squeezes everything out of us so that we become nothing but a clear channel through which the power of God can flow.
So, when we have the deepest troubles in life, and we go through these things we go through those of unfulfilled relationships and brokenheartedness and unsatisfied desires, and we suffer from those who should love us the most, remember, God is at work. The world can’t fix it and probably shouldn’t, because God is using it to reveal your spiritual character, to humble you, to draw you to Himself, to put His grace on display, and to make you powerful.
A few years ago, a song was written that really says it. I’ll close with this. It’s called “The Refiner’s Fire.” Listen carefully to the words. “There burns a fire with sacred heat/White hot with holy flame/And all who dare pass through its blaze/Will not emerge the same/Some as bronze, and some as silver/Some as gold, then with great skill/All are hammered by their sufferings/On the anvil of His will/I’m learning now to trust His touch/To crave the fire’s embrace/For though my past with sin was etched/His mercies did erase/Each time His purging cleanses deeper/I’m not sure that I’ll survive/Yet the strength in growing weaker/Keeps my hungry spirit alive.”
And then this great chorus, “The Refiner’s fire/Has now become my soul desire/Purged and cleansed and purified/That the Lord be glorified/He is consuming my soul/Refining me, making me whole/No matter what I lose/I choose the Refiner’s fire."
And when you can come to the point where you say that, you’ve reached a level of maturity and a grasp of the Christian life. No matter what I may lose, I choose the Refiner’s fire. The Refiner’s fire has become my soul desire, because I want to become weaker so that he may become stronger. Revealing your spiritual character, humbling you, drawing you to Himself, displaying His grace, demonstrating His power, that happens through your suffering. Embrace it and let God do His refining work.

1:2: MacArthur; “The purpose of trials”
1) First, trials come to test the strength of our faith. There is a great illustration of this in 2 Chronicles 32:31: “God left [king Hezekiah] to test him that he might know all that was in his heart.” Did you get that? That who might know? Well not God, God didn’t need to know by testing what was Hezekiah’s heart, he knew by omniscience right? Does God have to test you to find out what’s in your heart? No. God doesn’t have to test any of us to find out what’s in our heart.  God tests us so that we can find out.  In other words, he assists us in doing that spiritual inventory.  He assists us in self-examination.  I need to know and you need to know the strength of our faith and so God brings trials into our lives to demonstrate to us the strength or weakness of our faith.  
2) Secondly, we must recognize that trials come to humble us.  They come to remind us not to think more confidently of our spiritual strength than we should.  It’s closely connected to the first one, but a little different. They come not only to show us our strength, but they come to humble us, lest we think we are more strong spiritually than we are. 
3) I believe the Lord brings trials in our life also to wean us away from worldly things.  Because it is demonstrating their utter inability to solve any problem.  Or to provide for you any real resource in a time of stress.  We need to be weaned away.  
4) I think they call us to what we could call an eternal hope.  Trials in life, I don’t know how they work with you, but I know they work this way with me, trials in my life tend to make me want to go to heaven.  Have you noticed that?  That’s what I’m saying.  I don’t want to make it too difficult, it’s pretty simple.  They cause us to think on things divine, things heavenly. 
5) Fifthly, trials also serve a very important purpose because they reveal what we really love.  Could anything have been dearer to Abraham than Isaac, anything?  It’s questionable that anything could be dearer to him than Isaac.  Anything in this world, certainly God was dearer to him than Isaac, but that was the test.  To find out did he love Isaac more than he loved God or did he love God more than he loved Isaac, that’s the test.  You see trials will reveal what you really love by how you react.
You see, if you supremely love God, you are going to say thank you God, for what you are accomplishing through this.  Help me to see that.  And give you glory though you are allowing this to happen.  But if you really love self more than God, you are going to say, God, why do you do this and you are going to be irate and you are going to be upset and you are going to be bitter.  And you are going to be full of anxiety.
You see, there is a sense in which if anything is dearer to you than God, then he has to have it.   God wanted in the case of Abraham to let Abraham and all of us find out who Abraham loves most.  He said to him, Isaac, your only son whom you love.  Abraham passed the test.  Whom did Abraham love most?  God.  And that’s the value of the trial.  Abraham found he loved God most and everybody found out that.  That’s so important to note.  When you go through a trial, find out what it reveals about your love.
6) There is a sixth purpose in trials, that really is very, very helpful, and that is this.  Trials teach us to value the blessing of God. Reason teaches us to value the world.  Sense, feeling, tells us to value pleasure, faith tells us to value God’s world. God’s word.  God’s favor, God’s blessing.  Reason says, grab what you can grab in the world and go.  Sense and feeling says, find pleasure at any price.  Faith says, obey the word of God and be blessed.
⇒) What is God’s purpose as he tests us? 1) First to test the strength of our faith that we might know where our strength is or isn’t.  2) Secondly, to humble us lest we think more confidently of our spiritual strength than we should. 3) Thirdly, to wean us away from worldly things. 4) Fourthly, to call us to a heavenly hope so that we live in the above and not in the below.  5) Fifthly, to reveal what we really love;  6) To teach us to value the blessing of God and to appreciate it as it comes to us out of the times of suffering. 7) Seventh, to enable us to help others in their trial.  To bear one another’s burdens.  8) And eighth, to develop enduring strength for greater usefulness, so that God can thrust us into greater places of ministry and effectiveness.  
⇒) Now aren’t these all worthwhile purpose.  All these fit into the plan of God, by his grace. See, trials teach us the blessing of obedience.  In the midst of a trial, we obey and are blessed.  That’s what they are intended to teach.  They show us that obedience at all costs brings the blessing of God.

1:4: **Терпение.** Что такое христианское **терпение**? Это бездействие? Давайте попробуем подставить вместо "**терпения**" слово "бездействие": "*бездействие* же должно иметь совершенное действие, чтобы вы были совершенны во всей полноте, без всякого недостатка". Бред же, да? 
Значит "терпение" это всё-таки действие. Только действие, направленное направленное на самого себя. Терпение — это когда человек не думает, как бы исправить ошибки других людей, а это когда человек ищет способ изменить своё собственное поведение в конкретной ситуации. 
(Андроник Пантак)

1:4: **Терпение** — это не бездействие, не отступление, и не молчание, как некоторые считают: я буду терпеть и молчать. Терпение — это активная добродетель; это когда человек обращает взор в себя и ищет, что он может сделать в данной ситуации. По следующей схеме: 1) принять, что есть проблема; 2) сделать с собой, что могу; 3) остальное оставить Богу.
(Андроник Пантак)

2:3: **У ног моих**. В этом как раз и демонстрируется отношение к бедному человеку, о котором идёт речь. Так же контраст между "садись здесь" и "стань там".

2:5: **Бедных избрал быть богатыми верою**. Потому что чем больше достаток в обществе, тем меньше они нуждаются в Боге. Бедному человеку приходится полагаться на хлеб насущный, в то время как у богатого есть соблазн положиться на себя. Богатство может быть камнем 

2:5: **Бедных мира избрал**. Иисус предупреждал, что "трудно богатому войти в Царство Небесное" (Мф 19:23). Здесь рассматривается та же тема, но с другой стороны: именно бедные избраны для богатства в вере.

2:5: **Верою**. То есть, доверием к Богу, что Он будет заботиться о нас.

2:7: **Бесславят доброе имя**. Речь похоже идёт о богатых людях, которые вхожи в церковь, которых принимают с почётом, "проходите, присаживайтесь"... и о них думают, как о христианах. Их называют **добрым именем** Христинанина. Но жизнью своей они его **бесславят**, потому что жизнь их не соответствует имени. Таким образом, речь может идти о людях внутри церкви.
Но речь так же может идти и о людях вне церкви. В предыдущем стихе приводятся примеры притеснителей (*притесняют*, *влекут вас в суды*), и на этом примере Иаков может призывать не относиться с исключительным почтениям к людям просто за их статус.

2:8: **Закон царский**. Закон не печальный, бедный, и несчастный; **закон царский**.

2:10: **Согрешит в одном, виновный во всём**. Иаков предупреждает, что если человек согрешает в чём-то одном, то у него нет права говорить "а зато я в остальном молодец!". Закон Законом невозможно оправдаться. Нельзя говорить, что "я молодец потому что выполняю какую-то его часть". Зато я не прелюбодействую. Зато я не краду. Зато я не матерюсь.
Это особенно было актуально для фарисеев: кто нарушает закон в чём-то одном, тот нарушитель. Точка.

2:12: **Закон свободы**. Христианство это не масс ограничений, а свобода -- потому что для тех, кто Бога любит, это не ограничение. Это свободный выбор. Как с семьёй: для одих это "то нельзя, это нельзя", а для других это любовь и свобода. В тех же самых рамках можно испытывать свободу, благодаря любви.

2:18: **Вера из дел**. Здесь Иаков противопоставляет мёртвую веру живой: мёртвая вера не способна изменить жизнь человека. (Синодальный комментарий)

2:19: **Веруешь, что Бог един**. Здесь Иаков приводит в пример человека, который слышал о Боге, может быть даже совершает какое-то ритуальное поклонение, но не поклоняется Ему своей жизнью. Нет признаков роста.
Иными словами, это человек который знает о Боге, но не живёт для Него. Иными словами, знание не спасает.
Здесь у МакАртура есть великолепная иллюстрация из жизни апостола Павла: он преследовал Христиан. Павел хорошо знал, что они проповедуют, что Христос есть Бог, и что Он спасает нас от греха. Если бы не знал, не преследовал бы. Но лишь после встречи со Христом он стал не только знать, но и веровать, и следовать.


2:21: **Justified by works**. James apparently has a different sense of the word “**justify**” in view here, as evidenced by the different Scripture passages, and the different events in Abraham’s life, to which James and Paul refer. The primary way in which Paul uses the word “**justify**” (Gk. dikaioō) emphasizes the sense of being declared righteous by God through faith, on the basis of Jesus’ atoning sacrifice (Rom. 3:24–26), whereas the primary way that James uses the word “**justify**” (Gk. dikaioō) here seems to emphasize the way in which works demonstrate that someone has been justified, as evidenced by the good works that the person does (cf. Matt. 12:33–37). 

2:22: **Делами вера достигла совершенства**. Наш успех на пути с Богом измеряется не тем, что мы знаем, а тем, что мы делаем. (Лунёв)
