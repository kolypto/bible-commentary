## 2 Thessalonians

2:13: A wonderful statement: “**But we should always give thanks to God for you**.”  Why should we always thank God?  “Brethren, because God has chosen you from the beginning for salvation.”  That’s why we thank Him.  We don’t thank you for your salvation.  We don’t thank you for being bright enough, clever enough, spiritual enough, insightful enough.  We thank God for you because God has chosen you from the beginning, for salvation, through sanctification by the Spirit coupled with belief in the truth.  There has to be faith on your part, but that faith is the result of God’s choosing as He prompts it by His Spirit.
