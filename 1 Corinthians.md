## 1 Corinthians

Letter to a troubled church. Strife between the Jews and the Gentiles. The rich eating separately from the poor. Sexual immorality in the church. People were getting drunk at the Holy Communion! And that's a church Paul had planted. Imagine how he felt like hearing all these news.

1:4: That church had too much worldly attitudes in it, yet Paul calls it "**the church of God**", and people in it "**sanctified**". It is because no church is without issues; it is through overcoming those issues that people are sanctified.

1:10: чтобы не было разделений: 1) готовность поставить себя на другую сторону, с любовью, и пониманием, стараться преодолеть существующую проблему. Не просто отстаивать свои принципы, но стараться любить и понять. Готовность также принять тех кто в вере слабее тебя самого. 2) иметь единство как ценность; признавать насколько это важно. 3) авторитет Христа ставить выше человеческого лидерства. Признавать, что каждый верующий служит Христу: пусть и по-своему, но мы должны признавать брата. 4) направлять ко Христу, а не показывать свои достоинства. (МЦЦ, Мелешко)

1:18: (__the doctrine of total depravity)__ **Foolishness to them**. The doctrine of absolute inability (of total depravity). That doctrine says no sinner on his own can or will seek God. No sinner on his own will pursue the truth, will pursue righteousness, will come to reconciliation and salvation. He will not because he cannot. His condition as being dead in sin makes that impossible. And so the only ones who can come are those to whom God gives life and light and understanding and repentance and faith. And they are those whom He has chosen to give that to. God chooses whom He will save and God saves whom He has chosen.
Clearly, then, salvation is all of God.  It’s His people he has already identified.  But their salvation is not apart from their will, but it is in harmony with their will when their will is altered by the power of God. (MacArthur)

6:13: **Stomach is for food** expressed the common Greek notion that biological functions are just biological and have no moral significance. It was a belief many of the Corinthian believers had reverted to, or had never given up, in order to justify their sexual misconduct. Apparently, they were arguing that sex is simply a biological act, no different morally from eating or sleeping, but Paul strongly refutes that idea. The body is more than biological, as divine judgment will reveal. It is a member of Christ, therefore never to be used for any purpose that dishonors the God who made and indwells it. Christians should have but one response to sexual temptation: running away from it (v. 18). (MacArthur)

9:24: кто и с кем тут соревнуется? Верующие друг с другом? И только один победит? Вряд ли. Возможно, речь идёт схватке с самим собой, или с сатаной, и у каждого верующего это его личное единоборство. Единоборство: не затяжной бой, а схватка здесь и сейчас, из которой выйдет только один победитель.

9:25: какая награда? Древо жизни (откр 2:7)? Венком точно не является спасение (потому что мы его не заслуживаем своими делами). 

9:26: образ человека, бьющего воздух — это не образ бездействующего; это образ активного человека, который трудится, но делает это впустую. Потому что у него нет цели, или выбрана не та цель.

9:27: Каждый тренер был спортсменом. Павел говорит, что тренируя других, он продолжает тренироваться сам, чтобы не оказаться исключённым.

9:27: христианский путь это очень тяжёлой путь. 

10:12: If Paul gives a warning, there must be some sort of danger. **Falling** is a real opportunity. But what does "**falling**" signify? Temporary sin, or permanent loss of salvation? In v.5 Paul speaks about Israel, but by using so many Christian symbols, he hints at Christian believers, saying, that although many were baptized, and many partook of Christ, drinking His water (the Spirit) and eating His food (righteousness?), some of them have fallen off.

Verses 6 to 11 describe the dangers that Paul is taking about in v.12, that lead to **falling**. With such, God is not pleased (v.5), and they will be overthrown, even after being baptized and spiritually fed by Christ.

See Heb 6:4-6: "For it is impossible, in the case of those who have once been enlightened, who have tasted the heavenly gift, and have shared in the Holy Spirit, and have tasted the goodness of the word of God and the powers of the age to come, and then have fallen away, to restore them again to repentance, since they are crucifying once again the Son of God to their own harm and holding him up to contempt.".

10:12: Salvation is not a coin that can accidentally fall out of your pocket. It's a choice: you can refuse God and His salvation. So instead of "loss", "refusal" is a better term.

11:5: Feminist protesters against the traditional submissive role of women in a family had their heads shaven: the hair was the sign of femininity, and the protest was to remove it. Paul's point is, if a woman in church has taken the veil off, she may as well go the whole way and shave her whole head, joining the protesters, because you've done as much. Basically, Paul says, "you can't do that", because your society maintains a distinction between men and women, which is ordained by God (Dt 22:5: do not wear men's clothing, and vice versa), and you are to support this distinction. (MacArthur)

12:31: **A more excellent way**. In other words, a more excellent way than coveting the showy gift is to be content with the one you have. A more excellent way than lording it over somebody because you happen to have the gift of speaking or teaching, or whatever, or languages. A more excellent way than being proud is to be loving, and that’s what he talks about in 13 as he describes in beautiful language the more excellent way, which is love.
The Corinthian church had the gifts. The Corinthian church had a lot of things going on, had a lot of activity, but without love it wasn’t excellent; it was counterfeit. And they were selfish, and self-seeking, and operating in the flesh. And so chapter 13 sums up the more excellent way; not conflict in the body, not struggle, not self-seeking, not pride, not even envy, not even jealousy. None of those things have a place, only love, only love.
The truly spiritual life is the only life in which spiritual gifts can truly operate – okay? – and the truly spiritual life is not controlled by the gifts of the Spirit, it is controlled by the fruit of the Spirit. If you don’t have the fruit of the Spirit, then the gifts of the Spirit are functioning in the flesh. If there’s no love there, then what is coming off and what is being done is being done without the fruit of the Spirit; and if it’s being done without the fruit of the Spirit, it’s being done without the Spirit. It’s in the flesh, it’s fleshly, it’s carnal, it’s counterfeit. 
(MacArthur)

13:1: Keep in mind that it's not just a nice wedding text that Paul has written; he was addressing a troubled church, where people have forgotten about loving one another.

13:2: **I am nothing.** t doesn’t matter what you do. It doesn’t matter what I do. It’s nothing. It adds up to nothing. In fact, interesting to look at, verse 1 says, “The loveless person produces nothing of value, just noise.” Verse 2 says, “The loveless person is himself of no value.” “I am nothing.” Third verse, “The loveless person receives nothing of value.” “It profits me nothing.” Just a big nothing. Life minus love equals zero. (MacArthur)

13:3: **Deliver up my body to be burned**. It’s an interesting discussion about what it means to give your body to be burned. Some think it means to become a slave. In those days, when you became a slave they branded you with a hot iron that burned your flesh. And some say Paul is saying here, “Even if I became a slave, it wouldn’t matter.” That’s possible. But in line with the ultimate nature of Paul’s discussion here, it would seem to me that the epitome of what he would say would be, “If I would give my life to be burned, it wouldn’t matter.”
Now the argument against that is some people say, “Well, there was no precedent for that since that didn’t go on in that day.” Well, that’s true. There was not a burning-at-the-stake persecution at the time of Paul; that came later, and Christians were burned at the stake.
But there are several ways to look at it. One, he could have been referring to the burning that was going to come. And he could have been, by virtue of the insight of the Holy Spirit, been looking forward to those many Christians who were going to die at the stake for the wrong reasons. You know, one of the interesting things about the early martyrdom of the church was that many of those Christians developed a martyr complex, and they wanted to die as martyrs in order to become famous like other Christians who had died as martyrs. Now maybe he was anticipating that in the mind of the Spirit.
There’s another possibility too. There were some in the past who gave their lives to be burned: Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego. Though God delivered them, they were willing. But also, interestingly, right in the city near Corinth, the city of Athens, there was a tomb called the Indian’s tomb. A certain Indian had gone in that very spot, and had lit himself on fire and burned himself to death after he had written his epitaph. They built a monument there and this is what it said: “Zarmanochegas, an Indian from Bargosa, according to the traditional customs of the Indians, made himself immortal, and lies here.” So here was a guy who burned his body to gain some religious immortality.

13:4: Проповедь МакАртура на русском: см. __[Библия Заметки и Исследования, Любовь (1 Кор 13; МакАртур)](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://docs.google.com/document/d/1xuYSQvOAeMpBYUSRYeFJLLT8hQHX9iSXTUINCff1-ZI/edit%23heading%3Dh.62h1jx2d4b9h&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1582399365488000)__

13:4: (__not romantic/friendly love__) Which sorts of love are *not* in view here? The word “**love**” does never mean romantic or sexual love: in Greek, there’s another word for that, and it’s never used in the NT. For example, when it says in Ephesians 5, “Husbands, love your wives,” it isn’t talking about romance. 
“Love” in the Bible never means emotional love. He’s not saying the greatest of these is sentimentality. That too is not scriptural love.
It does not mean a friendly spirit of tolerance and brotherhood toward others, no matter what the convictions are; not the love that says “as long as there’s some common ground; we just got to love them all.”.
What is love? Love is an act of self-sacrifice. Love is not a feeling.
(MacArthur)

13:4: (__love is a verb__) The Bible never defines love. It never defines love in terms of abstracts, in terms of attitudes, in terms of feelings, in terms of ideology. It never defines love, it only describes love in action; because love is not an abstract, love is not a feeling. Love is not really an attitude; love is a deed, love is an activity.
In vv.4-7, English words are adjectives, but in the Greek, there are all verbs. And verbs describe action. 
Love is not something you describe with adjectives; love is something you describe as it functions. Love is only love when it acts; and that’s the way it’s presented in the Word of God.
(MacArthur)

13:4: **Love is patient**. Love is patient. This Greek word (*makrothumeō*) describes patience with people (not with circumstances). It is the ability to be wronged and wronged again and wronged again, and have the power to strike back but never even think of it. It describes the person who never ever gets angry. 
That’s something new to the Greeks: they would've never considered this to be a virtue; long-suffering for them is a weakness. In our days we also see people who strike back as courageous and manly. But The Christian is one who loves in response.
(MacArthur)

13:4: Love is **patient**, like God. Robert Ingersoll, the brilliant atheist – if any atheist could be classified as brilliant – lived in the last century, and he stopped, as he used to like to do, in the middle of one of his lectures against God, and he took out his watch and he held it up to his audience and he says, “I’ll give God five minutes to strike me dead for the things I’ve said.” That’s the way he use to mock God.
Well, he wasn’t struck dead. And somebody told this incident to the great Christian, Theodore Parker; and Parker smiled and said this, quote: “And did the gentlemen think he could exhaust the patience of the eternal God in five minutes?” (MacArthur)

13:4: Любовь **долготерпит**, как Бог. Роберт Ингерсолл, великолепный атеист — если какой-либо атеист вообще может быть назван "великолепным" — выступал в прошлом веке. Во время одной из своих лекций против веры и Бога он по своему обыкновению сделал паузу, прилюдно достал часы, и заявил: "Я даю Богу пять минут, чтобы поразить меня насмерть за слова, которые я только что сказал!". Так он дразнил Бога.
Ну... смерть его не поразила. Жил себе спокойно.
Когда же об этом эпизоде рассказали известному христианину, Теодору Паркеру, тот улыбнулся, и сказал: "И что же, этот джентльмен всерьёз считал, что может исчерпать терпение вечного Бога за каких-то пять минут?" (МакАртур)

13:4: **Love is kind**. We just spoke about patience, or long-suffering, and now here is kindness. Look: long-suffering endures the injuries of others, and kindness *pays them back*, only with good deeds. Long-suffering says, “I’ll take anything from my enemies.” Kindness says, “I’ll give anything. To my enemies, to meet their need.” Now that’s the essence of it: kindness is just the other side. 
The root word in the Greek is “useful”. “I will do anything that will be of use to my enemy, that will be of use to another. I will live my life to benefit others.” This is what kindness is: love is useful to other people. It’s not a sweet attitude when you feel good about others; love is the deed of kindness. It’s the act that you do for someone else that they need done.
(MacArthur)

13:4: **Love does not envy**. Jealousy exists on two levels. A superficial jealousy thinks: “I want what he has.” But a deeper jealousy will think, “I wish he didn’t have it.” The first thing is you want it, and the second is you resent that he has it. 
To envy in Greek comes from a root that means “to boil”: it’s the inner boiling, seething, steaming over somebody else’s success, somebody else’s beauty. 
But love is not envying. When love sees somebody who’s prosperous or popular, when love sees somebody who’s powerful or rich or beautiful or gifted, — love is glad for them and love rejoices.
This is how love works: a loving person rejoices in the excellencies of others. In the beauty of others. In the winsomeness of others. In the success of others. In the gifts of others. Holds no jealousy.
(MacArthur)

13:4: **Love does not boast**. The idea of bragging is to make somebody else feel like you are superior to them. And believe me, that is the opposite of love, because love says “I want *you* to feel superior, and I’ll take the role of a servant”. Boasting is geared to wound someone else, to make you stand out and make them look inferior. But love never brags. Love never blows its own horn. 
Somebody said, “Empty trucks make the most noise”. And let’s face it, nobody really likes people like that because they are loveless people. You know, when you get somebody around you like that, you don’t want to fellowship with them, you want to leave, or wish they did.
But what love does? While a prideful person can’t stop talking about himself, thinking “I’m better than you, and I want everybody to know all about me,”... Love says, “I wish I could know all about you.”. 
(MacArthur)

13:4: **Love is not arrogant**. Arrogance always goes together with boasting. **Boasting** represents the verbalizing of pride, the actual speech of pride, the actual action of pride, but **conceit** (being arrogant) is the attitude of pride. Conceit is the down side of boasting, the inner attitude that results in the windbag mouth.
The word for **arrogant** (Gk. phusioō) means “blowing”, like what you do with a balloon. That’s what “puffed up” comes from. And when a person is “blown up”, he has an exaggerated self-image, and all that hot air has to come out. A puffed up person tends to be a windbag as well. Those two come together.
But all that pride ever does is breed contention. All it does is ever start fights. Humility has never started a fight yet. Humble people haven’t got anything to argue about. They give.
You know, love is not big-headed; *love is big-hearted*! A love is superior to eloquence, to spiritual insight, to knowledge, to faith, to charity and martyrdom, love which suffers long and is kind.
(MacArthur)

13:5: **Love is not rude**. Love doesn’t behave rudely. This is such a practical thing. The verb here means “to behave in an unbecoming, unfitting, inappropriate manner”. Poor manners, rudeness. This is the opposite of love, because when a person has poor manners and is rude, he’s essentially declaring that “I don’t love you because I could care less what affects you. I will do what I want whether you like it or not!”
A person who is not willing to discipline his behavior with others in mind is totally self-centered. Love is never rude because love is always lost in how its actions affect somebody else.
(MacArthur)

13:5: **Love does not insist on its own way**. By definition, love is not aimed at oneself. Love is always aimed towards others. If not, it is not love.
This is probably the key to everything. “Love seeks not its own”. It’s the opposite of self-seeking. Love isn’t interested in its own things, love never seeks its own. Love is interested in the things of another person, love is always seeking somebody else’s. 
Lenski, the great commentator, said this. He said, “Cure selfishness and you’ve just replanted the Garden of Eden.”
This is – this is the key to the whole concept of love. It is selflessness. You’re patient with people. You’re kind with people. You’re not jealous of people. You’re not angry with people. You’re not upset with people. You’re not provoked by people. You’re very tolerant with people. You’re very generous with people. You’re very gracious with people. You’re never rude to people. All of that means you’re selfless.
(MacArthur)

13:5: **Love is not irritable**. Love is not provoked. The Greek word means a sudden outburst. Love never gets upset. Never gets irritated. Love is never is ready to fight. Never gets mad at other people.
Next time you get upset at home and you get mad, remember this: the reason you’re angry is because you don’t love the person you’re angry at. Because when you got angry, you said what you shouldn’t have said and you wounded them. And the reason you wounded them is because you wanted to wound them. And you know what? You decided “I want my way and I want it the way I want it. And if you don’t do it the way I want it, I’m going to hurt you.” 
You see, you say things that will never be forgotten. They leave scars. You do things that hurt and injure. Because at that moment, you don’t love that person. You’re more concerned about yourself than anything. If you have a problem getting irritated and upset, if you have a problem getting angry, getting mad, losing your control, losing your temper, it’s because you have a mindset that is selfish. In other words, your whole preoccupation is self-centered. You have a preset in your mind to determine that you are the one who matters.
You see, love bears the injuries suffered at the hands of others without any irritation because love is so totally selfless. It never gets on the defensive. It never defends itself. Love would feel the pain, love would suffer, but for that sensitivity it won’t issue an irritated, upset, angry, uncontrolled conduct. That is not Christlike.
Granville Walker said, “Love is the only cure for irritability, for irritability is only another manifestation of self-centeredness, and love that takes a man outside himself and centers the focus of his attention on the wellbeing of others is its only cure.” The sooner you learn that the thing that matters is everybody else, the less problem you’re going to have with what happens to your rights. So love is not upset, not irritated. It never gets angry.
Love suffers everything without irritation and without exasperation, unless it’s defending God. But when it comes to self, it takes it. 
(MacArthur)

13:5: **Love is not resentful**. Love remembers no evil. The word “remember” in greek is an accountant’s word that literally means “to keep a mathematical calculation”, a ledger of a bookkeeper. And the reason you write things in a bookkeeper’s ledger is so that you won’t forget them. And what he’s saying here is love never keeps books on the evil done to it. Love never keeps a running record of everybody’s offense. The idea is holding somebody accountable for some wrong or evil or injury. Love just forgives and forgets.
Chrysostom, the early church father, had a beautiful thought on this, he said, Love “is like a spark that falls into the sea and is quenched”. When an injury falls upon a loving Christian, it is drowned just as surely. And that’s the way it ought to be, drowned in the sea of love.
The very same word is used in the New Testament of the pardoning act of God. He keeps no account. Absolute forgiveness. That’s because He loves us, right? God so loved us that He doesn’t keep account of our sin, He just forgives it all and keeps on forgiving it and keeps on forgiving it and keeps on forgiving it. So as God has not kept any books on our sin, so are we not to keep any books on the evils of others.
But resentment keeps on keeping books about it. And so often we do that. We keep books and we brood over the record, and we read it and we reread it and we take the molehill of somebody’s offense and turn it into a mountain of hostility. That’s not something we’d like to admit, but I’m afraid it’s true.
Love never makes memories out of evils. Love fast forgets and sees past a person’s sin to their potential. Love hesitates to believe any rumor. Love always forgives, love never keeps account of wrong. It never gets irritated, as we saw, and it never is resentful. That’s love. Do you love like that? That’s the way Jesus loved, that’s the way we’re to love.
(MacArthur)

13:6: **Love does not rejoice at wrongdoing**. Love rejoices not in iniquity. “**Iniquity**” simply means “unrighteousness”, or sin. Love never rejoices in sin. 
How can anyone rejoice in sin? There are many ways. One way is when a person does something that he knows is bad, but speaks proudly about it. Or a person may have a mindset which tells them that something is acceptable because of this and that reason. Some people can be proud about how many women they had. Others tell stories about how they circumvented the law. Other people may boast in how they masterfully cheated someone. People would rejoice that they have gotten away with something. Some people may even rejoice in another person’s sin because it makes them look so much better in comparison! There may be many ways to rejoice in iniquity.
Always reminds me of the story of Ernest Hemingway. He told the Playboy magazine that “what is immoral is what you feel bad after”. But nothing made him feel bad, so by his own standard, he was a man of unimpeachable morals. Ten years later, in the very same magazine, the account of Hemingway’s life presented a chronicle of repeated suicide attempts, paranoia, multiple affairs, and a final and successful suicide attempt. Took a bullet and blew his brains out. A person won’t rejoice in sin long; only so much.
But you can’t rejoice in iniquity if you love. You know why? 
Speaking of love towards God, one cannot rejoice in things that are sinful because iniquity affronts God. Basic rule: if you love Someone, you don’t want Him to be affronted. And a Christian who rejoices in that, or who tolerates that, doesn’t understand what it means to love God. Because that is so very offensive to the holiness and the purity of God, that if you really loved God that would just make you feel cold inside, no place for rejoicing. So there’s no thought of rejoicing over evil.
And when it comes to loving people, it actually means hating their sinfulness. Not persons themselves, not; only the sinfulness they have in them: the habits, the mindset, the thinking, the actions. You can’t rejoice in any of it, because if you love that person, you can't rejoice at seeing that what he does is leading him to destruction. Because all sin leads to destruction: that’s one reason sins are sinful. Anxiety and worry would be a much more natural response from a loving person. A loving person would try to help others leave the path of destruction.
(MacArthur)

13:6: **Love does not rejoice at wrongdoing**. Now look at something that’s implied here: this verse hits at the idea of gossip because it gives no room for even recounting evil things. Love would not gossip, because gossip is never kind.
And I wonder, how much of our conversation would be silenced if we never gossiped about the faults and sins of other people? What if we didn’t read the paper, report the evil all over the place, if we didn’t talk about the failures and faults and sins of the people around us, what would we talk about?
But look at this. Love does not rejoice in iniquity, and if it does not rejoice in it, it isn’t happy to hear it, and it won’t be happy to pass it on. Love does not like to hear evil, and it does not want to pass it on.
Some people would argue, “well, it’s the truth we’re talking about!”. Listen, even if something is true, that does not mean you have to say it. But why would you pass around something that wounds and injures and chastens the person who did it? Why? If you were loving to God and loving to that individual, you wouldn’t.
I kind of like the definition of gossip that says this. “Gossip is vice enjoyed vicariously.” But love doesn’t do that. Love hates the sin. Love hates the way it hurts God and the way it hurts the sinner.
Granville Walker said, “There are times when silence is yellow. Times when we ought to stand on our feet and, regardless of the consequences, challenge the gross evils of the time, and these are the times when not to do so is the most blatant form of cowardice. But there are other times when silence is golden, when to tell the truth is to make many hearts bleed needlessly and when nothing is accomplished and everything is hurt by a loose tongue.”
He’s right, of course. You see, love never rejoices in iniquity. It never rejoices in what offends God and breaks God’s heart. It never rejoices in what harms the sinner. And so it never likes to hear it, let alone pass it on. 
(MacArthur)

13:6: **Love rejoices with the truth**. Love does not rejoice in evil; well, what does love rejoice in? Not it, but **with**. **With the truth**. It does not rejoice in unrighteousness, but with the truth.
Love only rejoices with the truth as taught and lived. Love can’t rejoice with error. Love can’t rejoice with false teaching. Love can’t tolerate wrong doctrine.
I can’t really enjoy being with a person and approvingly put my hand around him who teaches ungodly things, or who lives a life that goes against that truth, because the behavior of such a person will mess the joy up. Love will rejoice when truth is taught and lived. And believe me, the slightest compromise will take the joy out of love. I may love you, but if you teach error, I will not be able to rejoice about you. I won’t be able to, if I love.
In 2 John 6 we find an interesting helpful illustration of this: “And this is love: that we walk after His commandments”. Look, this is love, not a feeling, not an attitude, but obedience to the truth. “That what you have heard from the beginning, you walk in”. This is love: living God’s truth. 
Love walks after the commandments. Love operates in the area of the commandments, and love responds toward the people who teach the truth. But love doesn’t rejoice indiscriminately at anybody and anything who just happens to throw the name God or Jesus around.
Love isn’t saying, “Oh, well, it doesn’t matter what you believe” or “It doesn’t matter how you live. We love everybody anyway.” No. Love rejoices in seeing that others live according to it, and it doesn’t otherwise. Love may love a person, but it won’t rejoice if that person lives in error. 
Will love go around finding faults in people? No; love won’t be looking for faults in people, but rather, for their goodness. Love won’t subtract from people’s reputation, but will look for ways to add to it. Jesus could see in the life of a harlot (who washed his feet with penitent tears; Lk 7:36-50) a plus, when the Pharisee could see nothing but a minus. 
Love looks for the truth and the true behavior and it rejoices. And by rejoicing when there’s good behavior, it encourages that good behavior.
(MacArthur)

13:7: **Love bears, believes, hopes, endures all things**. After the eleven actions of love here comes the crescendo: the final four elements of love. Paul is really sort of flying by now, and they really kind of gather up some of the others as well. These four are ascending as we’re going from one to the next, and they’re closely tied. They just really go together.
(MacArthur)

13:7: **All things**. These statements are hyperbole: all things is not given in a universal sense; it’s an exaggeration. Love certainly has to make some discrimination. We have to test the spirits to see whether they’re of God. We won’t believe the devil, will we? Paul means “all things” within the limitations of proper biblical boundaries, proper Christian discrimnation, proper Christian sensibility. All things that come into the divine framework. (MacArthur)

13:7: **Love bears all things**. Let’s look at the first one. This is a tremendous word and I want you to see the depth of it. The word “**bear**” primarily means “to cover with silence”, or in one word, “to suppress” (also: “to conceal”, “ward off”, “endure patiently”). It doesn’t mean that love puts up with anything and that love can be shoved around because it doesn’t have any dignity. But what it does mean is that love out of a regard and a respect and an honest concern for the real value of another person, love will do everything it can to cover up and suppress the sin of that person. Genuine love is reluctant to drag a scandal in front of anyone. Love will warn, yes, and love will exhort and love will rebuke and love will discipline, but love will cover, not expose. It is disposed to cover ugliness in someone else’s life.
In contrast, depravity would normally want to uncover everybody’s evil. Just check out the news. True confessions. Dirty secrets of mrs. so-and-so, all women of mr. so-and-so. It’s jammed with exposés. Depravity is always looking to find the skeleton in somebody else’s closet because it gives a sense of self-righteousness, always. 
You know, I always question people who are married and all they can do is talk about the errors and the faults and the sins of their partner. I question whether they know the meaning of love because love throws a blanket over somebody else’s faults. Love throws a kindly mantle over the faults and weaknesses and sins of others. 
Have you ever noticed how easily you dismiss the faults of those you love? Think of the person you love the most, and they do something wrong. “Ah, well, there’s so much good about them. I mean everybody makes a mistake.” Now think about the person you don’t like. Or imagine that you didn’t like somebody and they do something wrong. Don’t think too long. 
Love always has this redemptive quality to it which is best evidenced by the cross of Jesus Christ, on which he redeemed from the world from its sins, because God so loved the world. Het is the covering of our sin.Love throws a mantle over sin because love has a redemptive element. Love is always after redemption. Love wants to redeem, it wants to buy back. Love is not judgmental, love is not condemning, love is redeeming.
There’s more. Love will actually be willing to go beyond throwing a blanket; love is so empathetic that love will be willing to feel the pain if necessary. And then love will redeem and forgive. And take the consequences of sin, if it has to. True love will have that redemptive quality.
On the cross, God didn’t just throw a mantle over sin, He didn’t just feel sympathetic about it, He did what? He bore our sins in His own body. Genuine love is never quick to exploit or expose or gloat or condemn. It throws a blanket over sin, carries the burden of it, even takes the blame for it, even accepts the punishment.
Love is not for the half-hearted, you know. Love is not for the sentimental. Love is the most tough, difficult thing there is. It isn’t for weaklings, it’s only for strength. It takes the most discipline, the most commitment, and the most faith of anything: to live by love.
Do we really cover other people’s evil? Love does. Love bears all things.

13:7: **Love believes all things**. This is in an ascending order: first love bears all things, and then love believes all things. Instead of suspecting the worst, instead of giving up, instead of denouncing the offender, love believes in the best in someone else. Love sees the wrong, love sees the weakness, it throws a mantle of silence over the weakness, it suppresses the sin, and then it believes the best. Love isn’t cynical nor suspicious of everybody and everything. Love wouldn’t presume that a person is evil and won’t be trying to find it. Even when seeing a person do wrong, love won’t think “Oh, I knew it!”. Love won’t think that a person is hopeless and will never change. Love always believes the best. And love believes that the person will change for the better.
So when somebody goes wrong and you say, “Ah, they revealed their true character,” it proves you don’t love them, because love doesn’t let go like that. You start hating somebody and you’ll start finding faults; but you start loving somebody and you’ll start covering. 
That’s the difference: love is a harbor of trust for those who are doubted by everybody else. So love believes. [And loves tries to see that “best”, find it, encourage it, and help it grow.]
(MacArthur)

13:7: **Love hopes all things**. We have just seen that love believes all things. Love believes there’s good within a person, and that the good will develop. But what love does when there’s no positive development? When it’s been 15 years and the person has not changed? What happens when love has kept believing until you don’t know if you can believe anymore?
Love will keep hoping, hoping that things can change even if they’ve gone too far. Because in its hope, love relies on God. As long as the grace of God is operative, human failure is never final. Because, really, is anything too hard for God?
You see, hope is a very long cord that love never gets disconnected from. If you keep hoping about a person, every once in a while this rope will pull at your heart, and you will pray for that person. And hope. And keep hoping. 
Love is hopelessly optimistic. It never stops hoping. Because God is still God, and He can do it. Love refuses to take failure as final. 
And many a loving wife has held onto a husband with nothing but that rope of hope. And many a parent to a child; many a friend to another friend, just holding onto hope. When all your faith gets clouded in, you have to hold on to hope. 
It is amazing that in such a situation when nothing has changed for the better despite all time and effort, and when there’s no more might to believe, and only hope is left, we are prone to make the worst judgments and think they’re the best. 
Don’t give up on hope. Love doesn’t. Love won’t say “well, I’ve lost faith in them totally. They’re out of it. There’s just no way, no hope, I give up.” Love doesn’t do that. When all of faith gets clogged up and fogged in, love still hangs onto hope. When doubt and despair steal faith, love still has hope.

13:7: **Love endures all things**.
(MacArthur)

16:14: Paul has just given four military commands; here’s a fifth: **be loving**. This is such an important one because it balances everything else off. Let all your things be done in love. That’s the beautiful softening principle.
What Paul leads us to is unretreating courage and unfailing **love**. And they have to come side by side. Too much love and not enough standing, and you’re going to wash away in sentimentalism. Too much standing and not enough love, and you’re going to be sort of an ugly theologian. Got to be both. Got to have love and sound doctrine. We see these things again and again through the New Testament. They’ve got to go together. Let everything you do be done in love. And by love we simply mean self-sacrificing service to the one in need, that’s all. Self-sacrificing service to the one in need. Not emotion. Not a feeling, but an act of love, an act of service. Jesus said, “Love one another as I have loved you.” The way he just loved them was to wash their feet and that’s how we love, by washing feet. That is meeting the need of a person who has a need.
We’ve got two things he says then, “You want to straighten your church out? Sound doctrine and love.”
