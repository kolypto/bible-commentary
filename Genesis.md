## Genesis

Introduction:
Reading Genesis 1-11 (Primeval history), readers will see that it’s designed to refute ancient delusions: God is almighty (not limited, like their human-like gods); the sun and the moon are not gods in their own right but are created by God; this God does not need feeding by man but He supplies man with food; it is human sin, not divine annoyance that prompts the flood. (ESV)




















### The Creation of the World

1: After declaring that God is the Creator of all things (v. 1), the focus of the rest of Genesis 1 is mainly on God bringing things into existence by His word and ordering the created things, rather than on how the earth was initially created. (ESV)

1:1: Although the Hebrew word for “**God**” (*Elohim*) is plural in form (possibly to express majesty), the verb “create” is singular, indicating that God is thought of as one being. (ESV)

1:1: **The heavens and the Earth** means “everything”, because in Hebrew there was no word for “universe”. Genesis is therefore the beginning of everything that exists. (MacArthur)

1:2: The initial description of **earth** being **without form and void** implies that it lacked order and content. The reference to **darkness** points to the absence of light. (ESV) 

1:3: The absolute power of God is conveyed by the fact that he merely speaks and things are created(ESV)

1:3: Everything that God brings into being is **good**. This becomes an important refrain throughout the chapter (see vv. 10, 12, 18, 21, 25, 31). (ESV)

1:7: This little phrase, **and it was so**, is here to indicate that it was so, and remained so throughout the life of the universe. That's a was of saying something was fixed, and it goes against the idea of progressive creationism that God has started some evolutionary process. He fixed it, it was firm, it was established. (MacArthur)

1:7: If the solar system was brought about by an accidental collision, then the appearance of organic life on this planet was also an accident, and the whole evolution of Man was an accident too. If so, then all our present thoughts are mere accidents -- the accidental by-product of the movement of atoms. And this holds for the thoughts of the materialists and astronomers as well as for anyone else’s. But if their thoughts -- i.e., of Materialism and Astronomy -- are merely accidental by-products, why should we believe them to be true? I see no reason for believing that one accident should be able to give me a correct account of all the other accidents. (C. S. Lewis)

1:7: Each particular thought is valueless if it is the result of irrational causes. Obviously, then, the whole process of human thought, what we call Reason, is equally valueless if it is the result of irrational causes. Hence every theory of the universe which makes the human mind a result of irrational causes is inadmissible, for it would be a proof that there are no such things as proofs. Which is nonsense. (C. S. Lewis)

1:9: God has made the planet in one day, fully mature, and with an appearance of age (MacArthur)

1:10: What does it mean that **it was good**? It means that it was ready for habitation. (MacArthur)

1:12: No evolution is remotely possible because there was no death, which only came with Adam's sin. The necessary prerequisite for having evolutionary processes is death, which makes natural selection possible. But there was no death, it doesn't even come before Gen 3. It was all **good**. (MacArthur)

1:14: How could God have created a world with light without celestial bodies to radiate it? "The only difference is this, that the light was before dispersed, but now proceeds from lucid bodies; which in serving this purpose, obey the command of God." (Calvin). God attached the light that He had created to luminaries. (MacArthur)

1:14: **Seasons. **The Hebrew word “seasons” doesn’t mean winter, summer, spring, and fall; it means “an assembling of the people” or “a gathering of the congregation”. In other words, the stellar bodies were literally to be used by God to establish certain gatherings of the people. And if you study the Old Testament, you will find out that all of the festivals, and all of the feasts, and all of the holidays of Israel were identified by where the heavenly bodies were at a certain time. They were all in relation, for example, of the vernal equinox or the full moon. (MacArthur)

1:16: By referring to them as **the greater light** and **lesser light** (v. 16), the text avoids using terms that were also proper names for pagan deities linked to the sun and the moon. (ESV)

1:25: At the end of verse, the creation of all these creatures gets a comment from **God**: He said that it was good. God has been saying this all along, by the way (v. 4: God said the light was good; v. 10: the land and the seas were good, v. 12: the plants were good; v. 18: stellar bodies were good too; v. 21 the sea creatures and the birds in the air were good; and finally, after he made man, he said that it was *very* good). Everything God made was good. No deformities, no mutations, no inferiorities, no natural selection, no survival of the fittest, because there were no unfit animals. (MacArthur)

1:26: The Hebrew word for **man** (*adam*) is the generic term for mankind and become the proper name, **Adam**. (ESV)

1:26: Previous God had used to say “let there be”, as if an impersonal form. But now the language changes, and He says “let us make”. Now, when God introduces Himself personally, as a Trinity, He uses the plural language. (MacArthur)

1:26: “**us**” may refer to the heavenly court (sons of God, or angels), but a significant objection is that man is not made in the **image** of angels. God is speaking to Himself, since God alone does the making. This would be the first hint of the Trinity in the Bible. (ESV)

1:27: Traditionally, the **image** has been seen as the capacities that set man apart from the other animals—ways in which humans resemble God, such as in the characteristics of reason, morality, language, a capacity for relationships governed by love and commitment, and creativity in all forms of art. (ESV)

1:28: To “**subdue**” (Hb. kabash) elsewhere means to bring a people or a land into subjection so that it will yield service to the one subduing it (Num. 32:22, 29). Here the idea is that the man and woman are to make the earth’s resources beneficial for themselves and for human beings in general. This command provides a foundation for wise scientific and technological development. (ESV)

1:29-30: God gave them **plants** **for food**, not flesh. There was no killing for food before sin entered the world in Gen 3:21, where God makes clothes from animal skins, and until Gen 9:3, where He allows Noah to eat every moving thing. (ESV)

1:31: Глядя на животный мир сегодня, трудно поверить, что глядя на это, Бог мог сказать "очень хорошо". Потому многие толкователи считают, что с грехопадением многое изменилось и в животном мире. Человек ранее был поставлен как правитель над животными миром и вершил волю Господа. Теперь же сатана пришёл и нарушил эту цепочку, стал принцем этого мира, действуя через человека, и мир изменился.

2:2: Just think of how we measure time. Our year is defined by the Earth's orbit. Our months are dictated by the moon (or rather, were). Our days follow sunrises and sunsets. But where do weeks come from? That have no astronomical meaning, and yet all peoples throughout the Earth follow the same pattern of seven-day weeks. And that's where it comes from: from the pattern that is established by God Himself. (MacArthur)

2:4: “**these are the generations**” is used multiple times in the book of Genesis to signify a new heading. The headings of Genesis are: The heavens and the earth; Adam; Noah; the sons of Noah; Shem; Terah; Ishmael; Isaac; Esau; Jacob.

2:4: Here starts the complementary account that zooms in on the sixth day of creation: a literary flashback that supplies more detail. (ESV)

2:4: Until now, the Creator was called by a generic word “God” (*Elohim*). In 2:4, the reader is now introduced to God’s personal name, “Yahweh” that  underlines the personal and relational nature of God. (ESV)

2:4: “Yahweh” is translated as “**LORD**” because of the ancient Jewish tradition of substituting in Hb. the term that means “Lord” [*’Adonay*] for “Yahweh” when reading the biblical text. The Septuagint customarily used “Lord” (Gk. *Kyrios*), and in this form it was quoted many times by the NT authors who also used “Lord” rather than “Yahweh”. This established the precedent for our modern translations. (ESV)

2:7: “**formed**” (Hb. yatsar) conveys the picture of a potter’s fashioning clay into a particular shape. The close relationship between the man and the ground is reflected in the Hebrew words used to denote them, *’adam* and *’adamah*, respectively. (ESV)

2:7: **the breath of life** — physical, mental, and spiritual — placed into the man made in God’s image. (ESV)

2:7: Man is called **a living creature** — the same word applied to animals in 1:20,24. While human beings have much in common with other living beings, God gives humans alone a royal and priestly status and makes them alone “in his own image”, giving him alone **the breath of life**. (ESV)

2:8: The name “**Eden**,” would have conveyed the sense of “luxury, pleasure”. Septuagint used the word *paradeisos* (from which comes the English term “paradise”) on the understanding that it resembled a royal park. (ESV)

2:8: Notice that **Eden** is not the name of the garden, but the name of the area the garden was located in. Moreover, in v. 10 it’s explicitly said that Eden and the garden were two different places: “flowed out of **Eden** to water the garden”. (ESV)

2:10-14: While the **Pishon** and the **Gihon** are unknown, the nearly universal identification of Tigris Euphrates suggests a possible location for Eden at either their northern or southern extremes. (ESV)

2:12: **Gold** and **onyx** are later associated with the making of the tabernacle and temple. (ESV)

2:17: The fruit of this **tree** has been variously understood as giving (1) sexual awareness, (2) moral discrimination, (3) moral responsibility, and (4) moral experience. The last is the most likely: by their obedience or disobedience the human couple will come to know **good and evil** by experience. (ESV)

2:17: “**In the day**” implies fixed certainty rather than absolute immediacy. (ESV)

2:17: What kind of “**death**” does this threaten: physical, spiritual, or some combination? The Hebrew word can be used for any of these ideas, and the only way to find out is by reading to see what happens as the story unfolds. (ESV)

2:18: **not good** is a jarring contrast to 1:31, where everything *was good*. Clearly, the situation here has not yet arrived to *very good*. It means that the woman was made on the same day with the man, before the creation became *very good*. (ESV)

2:18: a **helper** is one who supplies strength in the area that is lacking in “the helped”. A wife is **fit for him**, which means she is not exactly like him, but complements him. (ESV)

2:21: Men have XY chromosomes; women have XX.

2:23: “**flesh of my flesh**” highlights the sense of oneness and makes the point that marriage creates the closest of all human relationships. (ESV)

2:24: The kinship between husband and **wife** creates obligations that override even duty to one’s **parents**. In ancient Israel, sons did not move away when they married, but lived near their parents and inherited their father’s land. They “left” their parents in the sense of putting their wife’s welfare before that of their parents. (ESV)

2:25: The verse offers a picture of innocent delight. (ESV)

2:25: A play on the similar sounds of the words “**naked**” (Hb. *‘arummim*) and “crafty” (3:1, Hb. *‘arum*) links the end of this episode with the start of the next. (ESV)




















### The Fall

3:4: In both cases, the **serpent** questions the word of **God**: in v.2, he questions Eve’s understanding; in v.4, he openly contradicts God’s words, misinterpreting them, or even suggesting insincerity in God’s intention.

3:4: The **serpent** not only directly contradicts what God has said but goes on to present the fruit of the tree as something worth obtaining (ESV)

3:4: The irony should not be overlooked: the couple has been made in the image of God (Gen 1:26–27) and are in this way already like God. Moreover, they are expected to exercise authority over all the beasts of the field, which includes the serpent. This is not merely an act of disobedience; it is an act of treachery. Those who were meant to govern the earth on God’s behalf instead rebel against their divine King and obey one of his creatures. (ESV)

3:5: **You will be like God** (the whole phrase in Hb. *kelohim*)— not become completely like Him, but acquire a particular quality that God had, but they hadn’t: **knowing good and evil**. Ultimately, in their desire become *more *like God, just the opposite happened: they have become *less like God*.

3:4-5: The serpent was right that they **would not surely die** immediately, for Adam has lived for 930 years; and God acknowledges in v. 22 that “the man has become like one of us in knowing good and evil.”. Yet the serpent speaks half-truths, promising much but delivering little. Eating the fruit transforms the couple, but not for the better. They have come to know that they were naked, came to know evil by experience, were enslaved by it, and in their guilt they have became afraid to meet God, all resulting in them being cut off from the source of life and the tree of life, they are in the realm of the dead. (ESV)

3:4: The **death** they experienced first was not physical death, but spiritual **death**: a state in which a person cannot commune with God, does not accept God, does not even like Gof, is unable to choose God, and cannot and does not want to receive anything that comes from God. Adam and Eve used to live together with God, walk and talk with God, and by their very nature they used to do His will, they naturally loved God and obeyed God. But because of their transgression, they've been alienated from God: they've broken that relationship, and the spiritual separation manifested itself in a physical separation: being cast out. (~MacArthur)

3:5: We must not comment too severely upon her conduct. It was no mean desire which led her astray: she longed for more knowledge and greater perfection; she wished even to rise above the level of her nature; but the means she used were in violation of God's command, and so she fell. And, as usual, the tempter kept the promise to the ear. Eve knew good and evil, but only by feeling evil within herself. It was by moral degradation, and not by intellectual insight, that her ambitious wish was fulfilled. (Ellicott)

3:6: After the serpent’s comment, **the woman** started **seeing** the tree differently: she started thinking about it not as a taboo, but as something good and desirable, making up her mind to come and taste something that she had used to see as forbidden and unapproachable. The serpent has somehow made the woman discontent with the permitted trees, focusing her desire on this one.

3:6: The whole time Adam, **who was with her**, was around, and didn’t stop his wife. 

3:6: **gave some to her husband**. Adam has seen that Eve was not dead. So that means, God really is withholding something from them! (MacArthur)

3:7: **knew that they were naked**. when Adam and Eve disobeyed God, the first thing they experience is guilt and shame. Something they didn't know before. That is why they covered themselves. (MacArthur)

3:9: Both “**man**” and “**you**” are singular in Hebrew. God thus confronts Adam first, holding him primarily responsible for what happened, as the one who is the representative (or “head”) of the husband-and-wife relationship, established before the fall (ESV)

3:14: God addresses the **serpent **first (ESV)

3:14: Verse 1 declared the **serpent** “more crafty” (Hb. ‘arum); now **God** declares it more **cursed** (Hb. ’arur) (ESV)

3:15: Иисус назван **семенем жены**, потому что Он родился на земле без мужского семени от Пресвятой Девы Марии. (Православный Катехизис)

3:15: The two **seed**s can be seen in a simple sense as collective; that is, they may refer to all those who are part of satan's progeny and to all those who a part of Eve's. That view sees the war between the two as raging for all time, with the people of righteousness eventually gaining victory over the people of evil. But "**seed**" can also be singular, in that it refers to one great, final, glorious product of a woman, who will be the Lord Himself: born without male seed. In that sense, the prediction is messianic. In may be that the prophecy looks to both the collective and the individual meanings. (MacArthur)

3:15: The verse has traditionally been understood as pointing forward to the defeat of the **serpent** by a future **descendant** of the **woman**: a “Protoevangelium”, the first announcement of the gospel, the good news. This interpretation requires that the **serpent** be viewed as more than a mere snake, something which the narrative itself implies, given the serpent’s ability to speak and the vile things he says. This inference is legitimate and is clearly what the apostle John has in view in Rev. 12:9 (“the great dragon was thrown down, that ancient serpent, who is called the devil and Satan, the deceiver of the whole world”) and 20:2 (“ the dragon, that ancient serpent, who is the devil and Satan”).(ESV)

3:15: Some interpreters have suggested that by saying “**he**” and “**his**,” the intended meaning is that one particular **offspring** is in view. (ESV)

3:15: The serpent will still be able to hurt the seed, but the **bruising of the heel** is far less serious than the fatal injury the serpent suffers itself: **the bruising of the head**. (ESV)

3:15: **He shall bruise your head**. right in the middle of the curse, God promises that the times will change, and someone will come, he will restore paradise, and crush the serpent's. And immediately after this, God provides a covering for their shame. This is a loving God speaking. (MacArthur)

3:15: **Enmity, .. bruise your head, .. bruise his heel**. God speaks to satan here: “You thought that mankind will be your friends now, but I tell you: it isn’t going to be that way. The woman will not belong to you: she will be your enemy and you will be her enemy. And out of her loins are going to come those who belong to Me. They will be the enemies of those who belong to you, and in the end, out of her loins is going to come the One who will crush your head, and all you’ll be able to do is bruise His heel.” (MacArthur)

3:16: Ветхозаветное проклятие — это не программирование реальности, а просто констатация факта: как оно будет устроено до второго пришествия. (Андроник Пантак)

3:16: В этом тексте есть как проклятия, так и благословения. Причём «проклятия» здесь, как и во всей Библии - это не «программирование реальности» (Бог не программирует зло), а печальная констатация факта, что в будущем с людьми будет происходить всякая ерунда.
Проще говоря, в идеальный отлаженный Богом механизм с красивыми шестеренками, люди всадили громадный такой металлический лом. Механизм не развалился сразу, но стал работать заметно хуже. Так вот, «проклятия» в этом тексте - это рассказ о том, как теперь работает механизм мира с вставленным в него ломом, а «благословения» - это инструкция, как теперь с этим жить, чтобы было насколько возможно хорошо.
Так, например, Адаму Бог говорит, что он в поте лица будет есть хлеб свой, а земля произрастит сорную траву и колючки. Здесь и проклятие, земля будет взращивать всякую дурную траву, и благословение трудиться. Теперь, после изгнания из рая, мужчина деградирует, если не преодолевает внешние, не бытовые трудности, и Господь направляет его трудиться в поте лица, если мужчина хочет, чтобы ему и его окружающим было хорошо. Жене, кстати, такой необходимой обязанности не вменяется. Златоуст пишет об этом: «Нигде не назначается ей работа, нигде — пот и нигде — труд, но уныние и стенание» (скачки настроения и послеродовая депрессия? 🤔)
Так вот, есть в этом тексте интересные слова, обращённые к Еве. В русском переводе они звучат так: «В болезни будешь рождать детей; и к мужу твоему влечение твое, и он будет господствовать над тобою». Интересны слова «к мужу твоему влечение твоё». Недавно один из преподавателей нашей семинарии, гебраист, рассказал мне такую интересную вещь. Оказывается в оригинале этот текст можно прочитать двояко. «К мужу твоему влечение твоё» и «Над мужа твоего стремление твоё».
Если мы берём первый вариант, то он может видеться не совсем точным. Потому что у мужчин влечение к женщинам зачастую даже больше, чем у женщин к мужчинам. А если мы возьмём за основной второй вариант, то многое становится ясно. Господь предупреждает женщин, что теперь у них будет постоянное желание встать над (перед) мужем. Что мы часто и видим в жизни.
Кстати, в Библии все благословения и проклятия прописаны в стихотворной форме, и, при прочтении с указанным смыслом, появляется красивая поэтическая антитеза: у тебя будет влечение встать над мужем, но он будет господствовать над тобой. Слова «он будет господствовать над тобой» уже не проклятие, а благословение. То бишь инструкция, как сделать, чтобы женщине было хорошо. Причём это благословение сформулировано ровно в тех же грамматических формах, что и благословение Адаму трудиться в поте лица.
В общем, мужчины, Господь предупреждал. У женщин всегда будет искушение взять инициативу в свои руки. Важно жить так, чтобы жена была уверена, что вы можете быть хорошим капитаном. Ну, а чтобы никто не подумал, что эти слова про господство - это про абьюз и тиранию, вспомним ещё раз совет мужьям от святителя Феофана Затворника: «Власть эта должна быть не деспотичной, а любовной. Имей жену подругою, и сильной любовью заставляй её быть покорной тебе». Сильной любовью.
(Андроник Пантак)

3:16: By way of punishing the woman for her sin of disobedience, God pronounces that she will **suffer pain** (Hb. *‘itstsabon*) in the **bearing of children**. This strikes at the very heart of the woman’s distinctiveness, for she is the “mother of all living” (v. 20) (ESV)

3:16: **Your desire shall be contrary to your husband, but he shall rule over you**. These words from the Lord indicate that there will be an ongoing struggle between the woman and the man for leadership in the marriage relationship. The leadership role of the husband and the complementary relationship between husband and wife that were ordained by God before the fall have now been deeply damaged and distorted by sin.
The consequences: (1) Eve will have the sinful “desire” to oppose Adam and to assert leadership over him, reversing God’s plan for Adam’s leadership in marriage. But (2) Adam will also abandon his God-given, pre-fall role of leading, guarding, and caring for his wife, replacing this with his own sinful, distorted desire to “rule” over Eve. Thus one of the most tragic results of Adam and Eve’s rebellion against God is an ongoing, damaging conflict between husband and wife in marriage, driven by the sinful behavior of both.
The Hebrew term here translated “**desire**” (*teshuqah*) is rarely found in the OT. But it appears again in 4:7, in a statement that closely parallels 3:16 — that is, where the Lord says to Cain, just before Cain’s murder of his brother, that sin’s “desire is contrary to you” (i.e., to master Cain), and that Cain must “rule over it” (which he immediately fails to do, by murdering his brother, as seen in 4:8). 
(ESV)

3:16: У тебя будет желание главенствовать над мужем, но нормально жить ты будешь только если он будет властвовать над тобою. (Андроник Пантак)

3:16: **Your desire shall be to your husband**. Some have suggested that this means a sexual desire, but that's certainly not a punishment. Moreover, sex is something that God has given them before the Fall; how else could He say, "be fruitful and multiply" (Gen 1:28)?
This means something else. This means that her desire – her desire is going to be something negative, something that reflects separation and alienation. Up to this point everything does.
Let's look at the language. The word "**desire**" comes from an Arabic root meaning "to seek control". Literally, it reads "you shall seek to control over your husband". That is a sign of the curse.
This desire shows up in various women in various ways. In some of them it’s a quiet, silent desire that smolders, with others it is a shouting desire that isn’t much of a secret to anybody. And the more godless women are, very often the more hostile they are toward men. Sometimes that hostility takes the attitude of coldness, indifference, apathy. Because she can’t achieve what she wants, she eventually becomes totally indifferent and apathetic toward the man. (MacArthur)

3:17: **To Adam He said**. The curse is on the sphere where the person lives. 
Man's sphere is represented by the field in which he works. 
Woman's sphere is represented by the family, in which she has pain in labor, and conflict with her husband. 
The curse strikes to the very heart of what the person is doing.
(MacArthur)

3:19: Again, the punishment strikes to the very heart of man’s nature: the punishment of the man involves his relationship with the very **ground** from which he was formed. The punishment is not work itself (cf. 2:15), but rather the hardship and frustration that will accompany the man’s labor. Underlying this judgment is a disruption of the harmonious relationship that originally existed between humans and nature. (ESV)

3:19: That the man **is dust** was not news to the man, but his the **returning to the dust** was. Death sounds normal and natural to us, but to Adam, it was the introduction of a new fearful concept into his world.

3:19: The second part of man’s punishment was that the man’s body will return to the ground, i.e., it will die. Death has entered the world. (ESV)

3:20: **Eve**, which means, life. Adam calls his wife “life” because she was the mother of all the living. Well, I got news for you, folks. At the time that he named her, she was the mother of nobody. She was the mother of nobody. 
God has said that He will provide an atonement, He will provide the conqueror of Satan and sin who will restore paradise and rescue the sinner. On the basis of that promise, Adam gives name to his wife. 
This tells me that Adam trusted God. God had only said one thing to him, just one thing, really, that he gripped about the future and that is that there would be a seed who would come. Adam became a believer, like Abraham. (MacArthur)

3:21: There is an opinion that those **skins** might have been bodies, borrowed from an animal, and used as a vessel for human beings, who previously used to shine, like Jesus did (Origenes)

3:21: As a gesture, **God’s clothing** of the rebellious couple suggests that God still cares for these, his creatures. (ESV)

3:21: Because **God** provides **garments to clothe** Adam and Eve, thus requiring the death of an animal to cover their nakedness, many see a parallel here related to (1) the system of animal sacrifices to atone for sin later instituted by God through the leadership of Moses in Israel, and (2) the eventual sacrificial death of Christ as an atonement for sin. (ESV)

3:21: **garments of skins**. God killed an animal in order to cover their shame. This is the first illustration of s substitutionary sacrifice: an innocent animal had to die in order to cover the sins of a guilty party. And God is the one who killed here. This is, of course, an illustration, and the prototype, for temple sacrifices, and for the ultimate sacrifice of Jesus for our sins. (MacArthur)

3:23: **Knowing good and evil** was somehow incompatible with **living forever**: no good would have come out of it. What precisely would that be is uncertain: perhaps, would remove the possibility of repentance, resulting in eternal separation from God?

3:23: The expelling of man from the garden was an act of love and mercy. For the man to live forever would have sealed his sinful condition, and God has prevented that by expelling man out of that garden.

3:24: After Adam and Eve sinned, God banished them from the Garden of Eden If they had eaten from the tree of Life, they would have been forever in their sin. It was an act of mercy that God banished them from the garden. (Brad, Дом Отца)




















### Cain and Abel

4:1: This chapter shows mankind plunging further into sin, with Cain murdering Abel, and Lamech boasting of a murder for a simple offence. (ESV)

4:1: Eve’s reference to the Lord’s help when Cain is born conveys a sense of optimism. The serpent may yet be overthrown by the offspring of the woman. (ESV)

4:4: The key to understanding the **Lord’s regard** for Abel’s gift is not in the gift itself, but the attitude of the heart that undergirds the actions and the response to them. God knows what’s in the heart of man, doesn’t He? And so in v. 7 God explained to Cain that his gift was rejected not because God doesn’t like farmers, but rather, because Cain has done something wrong while offering the gift. Probably, he was insincere.

4:4: **The firstborn of his flock** is a more costly offering, expressing greater devotion. (ESV)

4:4: At no point does the Bible suggest that **offerings** work *automatically*, as if the worshiper’s faith and contrition did not matter; and Cain’s fundamentally bad heart can be seen in his resentment toward his brother and in his uncooperative answers to God in the rest of the passage. (ESV)

4:4: God has rejected one **gift** and **accepted** the other “because his [Cain’s] own deeds were evil and his brother's righteous” (1 Jn 3:12)

4:7:  The Lord’s words challenge Cain to do better. He still has the possibility of turning. To succeed in doing this, however, he must overcome the domination of **sin**. (ESV)

4:8: God has explained to Cain that his gift was rejected because of a wrong in his heart (v. 7: “if you do well, will you not be accepted?”). Still, Cain saw no fault with himself, but instead grew envious of his brother. Instead of repenting himself, he envied the one who was more right with God. This twisted thinking has led to murder.

4:8: Obviously, Cain did not “rule over” his sin (v. 7), but instead, let the sin rule over himself.

4:13: Cain is immediately conscious of the severity of his **punishment**: he is to be alienated from both the ground and God. While this may seem like a very lenient sentence, it meant that Cain would become a fugitive and a wanderer on the earth. (ESV)

4:15: **The mark**. In spite of much scholarly speculation, the precise nature of **the mark** is uncertain. It must have been something visible, but that is all that can be said. (ESV)

4:17: No explanation is given as to the origin of **Cain’s wife**. As is often the case in Genesis, the limited and selective nature of the account leaves the reader with unanswered questions. Presumably, Cain married his sister—a reasonable assumption, since the whole human race descended from Adam and Eve (Gen 3:20: “Eve … the mother *of all living*”), and Adam with Eve had “other sons *and daughters*” (Gen 5:4). (ESV)

4:20-22: Can’s immediate descendants are associated with animal breeding, music, and metalwork, all of which are noteworthy cultural and technological developments. (ESV)

4:23: Seven generations on from Cain, **Lamech** resembles his ancestor, but seems to be worse. His response is out of proportion to the injury, showing his inordinate vengefulness. (ESV)

4:23: God’s wisdom is not to take revenge but forgive; Lamech’s wisdom is the opposite: take revenge in such a way that it’s worse than the initial offense. It’s not even just repayment; it’s much worse.

4:24: Lamech is boasting that his vengeful passion makes him safer than Cain (Gen. 4:15), who had protection only from God. “Seventy-sevenfold” is a picturesque statement for extravagant excess. (ESV)        

4:25: It is noteworthy that there’s been no mention of **God** while the text was talking about Cain’s descendants; likely because they were wicked and godless.

4:25: With Eve’s line, the text starts mentioning **God’s** role in Adam’s family again. He clearly works in their lives to provide the promised offspring. 

4:26: Details are not given, but the implication may be that this **calling on the Lord’s name** began in Adam’s own family circle. (ESV)




















### Adam’s Descendants

5:3: While this implies that **Seth** is made, like **Adam**, in the divine **image**, it also suggests that he images his father as well; Seth’s line, however, is certainly portrayed more positively than that of Cain. (ESV)

5:4: One of the most striking aspects of the passage is the great age of the first people in Genesis. The traditional understanding is that the numbers should be taken at face value, often assuming that something changed in the cosmology of the earth or in the physiology of humans (or in both) after the flood, resulting in a rapid decline in longevity, finally stabilizing at a “normal” life span in the range of 70 years or 80 years (Ps. 90:10: “ The years of our life are seventy, or even by reason of strength eighty“). In any case, one clear implication of these genealogies is that these people actually lived (regardless of how long), and that they actually died. (ESV)

5:5: **Lived 930 years**. You complain that you have to work a lot and you can only retire when you are 60? Give me a break! Adam lived in toil *for 900 years*! And that -- after living in the Garden, where everything was growing by itself! (MacArthur)

5:23: The number **365** had no special significance to Hebrews.

5:24: **Enoch** is one of the three people in the Bible who were raised to Heaven in a bodily form: Enoch, Elijah, and Jesus Christ.

5:24: Unlike all the other members of this genealogy, **Enoch** did not die, but was **taken** by God.

5:24: The Hebrew verb for “**walked**” is a distinctive form that conveys the sense of an ongoing intimacy with **God**. Remarkably, because of this special relationship, **Enoch** does not die. (ESV)

5:24: This line is clearly presented as offering an alternative to the line of seven generations linked to Cain: whereas Cain’s line leads to a killer in the seventh generation, the comparable generation in Seth’s line produces Enoch, who walked with God and did not die. (ESV)

5:27: There’s an English expression that dates back to 1300s: “old as **Methuselah**”

5:27: **Methuselah** died in the year 1656 after creation; because he hasn’t been in the Ark, the flood must have taken place after he died. Further, Arphaxad, the son of Shem, was born in the year 1658 after creation, and because there is no mention of him when Noah’s family had entered the ark, the flood must have taken place before his birth.
In the end, the flood must have happened in the years 1656-1658 after creation. It is indeed possible that Methuselah, who outlived his son Lamech, has died in the flood.

5:31: The number **777** does not look that nice in Hebrew: שֶׁ֤בַע (še·ḇa‘). 

5:31: **Lamech’s 777** years provides an interesting point of contact with his namesake in Ch. 4, where another Lamech, a descendant of Cain, boasted for murdering a man for striking him, and talking about a seventy-sevenfold vengeance (Gen 4:23-24: “Lamech said to his wives: ... I have killed a man for wounding me, a young man for striking me. If Cain's revenge is sevenfold, then Lamech's is seventy-sevenfold”). (seventy-seven: וְשִׁבְעָֽה׃ (wə·šiḇ·‘āh))




















### Noah and the Flood

6:1: he motif of multiplying is first introduced by God in 1:28, where it is presented in a very positive light and viewed as necessary to fulfill God’s plans for the earth. The present passage, however, reveals that this God-mandated task leads to increasing wickedness on the earth as the population expands. (ESV)

6:2: Various scholars have proposed that the “**sons of God**” are (1) fallen angels; or (2) tyrannical human judges or kings (in the ungodly line of Lamech, possibly demon-possessed); or (3) followers of God among the male descendants of Seth (i.e., the godly line of Seth, but who married the ungodly daughters of Cain). Though it would be difficult to determine which of these three views may be correct, it is clear that the kind of relationship described here involved some form of grievous sexual perversion, wherein the “**sons of God**” saw and with impunity took any “**daughters of man**” that they wanted. The sequence here in Gen. 6:2 (“**saw** … **attractive** [good] … **took**”) parallels the sequence of the fall in 3:6 (“saw … good … took”). In both cases, something good in God’s creation is used in disobedience and sinful rebellion against God, with tragic consequences. (ESV)

6:3: God announces that because of the immoral nature of people, **their days shall be 120 years**. There are two possible interpretations of this number of years: either the lives of human beings will no longer exceed 120 years, or the coming of the flood is anticipated in 120 years. (ESV)

6:3: Some interpreters take **120 years** as the countdown to the Flood.

6:4: Although in Hebrew **the Nephilim** means “fallen ones,” the earliest Greek translators rendered it gigantes, “giants” (This idea may have been mistakenly deduced from Num. 13:33: “we saw the Nephilim ... and we seemed to ourselves like grasshoppers”). One must be cautious about reading “giants” back into the present passage. The **Nephilim** were **mighty men** or warriors and, as such, may well have contributed to the violence that filled the earth. (ESV)

6:6: **God** is **grieved** over his creation, which he at first saw as very good (1:31) but which is now filled with sin. (ESV)

6:8: **Noah** is distinguished from the rest of humanity. Apart from Noah, the only other person in the OT who is described as **finding favor in the eyes of the LORD** is Moses, in Ex. 33:17. (ESV)

6:9: The Hebrew for **blameless** conveys the sense of being perfect, without evident flaw (although not necessarily sinless). The positive attributes listed here are rarely ascribed to human beings in the OT.  (ESV)

6:17:  It is possible that the flood, while universal from their viewpoint, did not cover the entire globe. Indeed, Genesis implies that prior to the Tower of Babel incident (see 11:1–9), people had not yet spread throughout the **earth**. Many interpreters, therefore, argue that a huge regional flood may have been all that was necessary for God to destroy all human beings.
In support of the view that the flood covered all the **earth**, other interpreters point out that the text says that “all the high mountains under the whole heaven were covered” (7:19) and that the water was “fifteen cubits” above the tops of the mountains. If the mountain range of Ararat was covered, that would be sufficient to cover the entire globe.
(ESV)

7:1: The reason for **the Lord’s** choosing of **Noah** is that he was **righteous**: the fact that has already been emphasized twice (Gen 6:8, 9, implicitly 13).

7:5: Ной строил ковчег 70 лет (см. Быт 6:3), и строил его на суше. Удивлённые, люди ходили вокруг, и спрашивали: а что это ты делаешь? На что он отвечал: строю ковчег, чтобы когда Бог пошлет воды, спастись в нем. Очевидно, что принять его всерьёз могли только те, кто верили в Бога так же, как он. Таковых не оказалось.

8: The chronology of the Flood:
2/10, Sun: Announcement of the flood 7 days in advance (Gen 7:4,10)
2/17, Sun: Flood begins; Noah and family enter the ark (Gen 7:11,13)
3/27, Fri: Flood lasts 40 days and ends (Gen 7:12)
7/17, Fri: Ark rests on Ararat after waters prevail and abate for 150 days total (Gen 8:4)
10/1, Wed: Mountaintops eventually become visible (Gen 8:5)
11/10, Sun: Raven sent out (after 40 days of mountaintop visibility) (Gen 8:7)
11/17, Sun: Dove sent out; returned (Gen 8:8)
11/24, Sun: Dove’s second flight (7 days later); returns with olive leaf (Gen 8:10)
12/1, Sun: Dove’s third flight (7 days later); does not return (Gen 8:12)
12/17, Wed: Waters fully abated; end of second 150-day period (Gen 8:3)
1/1, Wed: Noah eventually removes the covering of the ark (Gen 8:13)
2/27, Wed: Earth dried out; Noah leaves ark (Gen 8:14-19)
(ESV)
Numbers:
150 days waters prevail, 150 days waters abate, 70 days earth dries out; Total: 370 days in ark.
The “40 days”: flood lasted 40 days; raven sent out after 40 days of mountaintop visibility
( not interesting: 
Sundays: flood announced; flood began, ravens &amp;amp; doves sent out
Fridays: deluge ended; ark rested; 
Wednesday: mountaintops visible; waters fully abated; Noah removes the covering; earth dry)
Dates repeat: 10, 17, 27; do not repeat: 1, 24

8:13: The new earth has become ready on the very first day of the new year, the **first month**.

8:13: Even though the **earth looked dry**, Noah did not leave the ark until God told him to do so in v. 16. This fact says that Noah trusted God’s direct guidance more than his own understanding.

8:17: God’ instructions to **be fruitful and multiply** are reminiscent of the words God had said to Adam. (ESV) Noah and his family represents the new humanity.

8:20: **The Lord** had made a provision for this sacrifice when told Noah to take more than one pair of those ritually clean birds. Whether God had commanded Noah to make an offering is not clean, but God had foreseen this episode.

8:20: Noah’s first recorded act on emerging from the ark is to **build an altar to the LORD**. It is an act of gratitude, but also of atonement: the Hebrew for “**pleasing**” (Hb. *nikhoakh*) conveys the idea of rest and tranquility. It is related to the name “**Noah**” (Hb. *noakh*). It also has the sense of “soothing.” The burnt offering soothes God’s anger at human sin.(ESV) 

8:20: This is the point where Noah’s name (rest) is fulfilled: God’s anger at human sin has been *noakh*ed: soothed/rest/tranquility.

8:20: **Noah’s** practice and ceremonial functions parallel the festival of Shavuot and sheds light on his priesly functions: God’s first priest. (Wikipedia)

8:21: Notice how this verse echoes very closely 6:5 (“every **intention** of the thoughts of his **heart** was only **evil** continually”). In spite of the human propensity to sin, atonement through sacrifice is possible, securing a peaceful relationship between the Lord and humanity. (ESV)

8:22: God promised that everything will be as it is for as long as **the earth remains**, He will not interfere on a grand scale. He gave this promise, and it is evident that God holds to His promise to this day: people ask why, oh, why, there is so much evil in this world, and God does nothing? Because there had been much more evil in the world (Gen 6:5: “every intention of the thoughts of his heart was only evil continually”), and God had “repented that He had made man” (Gen 6:6), and wiped the earth clean with a flood, leaving only one righteous man and his family alive. Earth has become much better, but still God sees that the human heart is so wicked by its nature that “**the intention of man's heart is evil from his youth**”. Even seeing this,God promised not to destroy the earth again. 
God gave this promise when Noah, being obedient, made an offering to God. This probably explains why this promise has been given: because of the righteous people living on this earth, it will remain.
The very same pattern of reasoning is clear in Gen 18:26 where Abraham pleads with God for Sodom, and God promised that He will not destroy the whole city — because of the righteous people living in it.

9:1: **God** says the words similar to those He had said to Adam, because Noah is a sort of second Adam, in that he (like Adam) is father of the whole human race. (ESV)

9:2: To Adam was given the dominion; in Noah’s time animals started to **fear** the human. (ESV)

9:3: The second difference is in that humans are now given permission to be carnivorous. (ESV)

9:6: Violence by “all flesh” prompted God to send the flood (6:11, 13). If human nature has not improved after the flood (8:21: “evil from his youth”), how is violence to be prevented in the future? This legal enactment is the answer: From his fellow **man** I will require a reckoning for the life of **man**, i.e. will be held accountable by God, working through human representatives (“**shall be shed**”). (ESV)

9:6: Here the principle of *talion*, a life for a life, is applied. Human life is to be valued so highly that it is protected by this system of punishment because God made man in his own image, and so to murder another human being is to murder what is most like God, and is thus implicitly an attack on God himself.  (ESV)

9:7: God wants humanity to flourish and not to be destroyed by violence or another flood. This positive view of population growth stands in sharp contrast to the Babylonian flood story, which ends with the gods taking measures to inhibit mankind from filling the earth. (ESV)

9:9: This is the first **covenant** explicitly named in Genesis. A covenant formally binds two parties together in a relationship, on the basis of mutual personal commitment, with consequences for keeping or breaking the commitment. (ESV)

9:13: Different **covenants** have appropriate signs or symbols linked to them. Circumcision is the sign of the covenant with Abraham (ch. 17), and the Sabbath is the sign of the covenant with Israel at Mount Sinai (Ex. 31:12–17). On this occasion God’s designated **sign** is the **rainbow** (Gen. 9:13). Its presence, when rain clouds are in the sky, will be a visible reminder of God’s everlasting covenant (v. 16). (ESV)

9:18: The objective of the story may have been to justify the subject status of the **Canaanites**, the descendants of **Ham**, to the Israelites, the descendants of Shem. The narrative's short five verses indicate that Canaan's Hamite paternity must have had great significance to the narrator or redactor, according to Sarna, who adds, "The curse on **Canaan**, invoked in response to an act of moral depravity, is the first intimation of the theme of the corruption of the Canaanites, which is given as the justification for their being dispossessed of their land and for the transfer of that land to the descendants of Abraham."[13] (__[Wikipedia](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curse_of_Ham&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1582399365181000)__)

9:18: The text emphasizes the origins of **Canaanites** by naming them twice. The reader who knows that Canaanites were pagan semitic tribes who have been conquered by Israel, and to that reader the text would explain the reason why this conquest has taken place. Descending from a father like **Ham** casts a shadow on on the whole nation.

9:19: By implication, there were no other humans on the **whole earth**, because all people descended from **these three**. No Nephilim or other human beings were around. (ESV)

9:21: **Nakedness** may associate Noah with the original sin, one manifestation of which was the awareness of nakedness.

9:22: Though the text does not explicitly state what happened, it is clear that **Ham** humiliated and dishonored his father and that he apparently sought to make his brothers a party to that humiliation. Instead, Ham’s **brothers** make every effort to avoid seeing Noah’s **naked** body. (ESV)

9:22: The expression "**look upon**" at times has sexual overtones in the Bible, as in Leviticus 20:11, "The man who lies with his father's wife has uncovered his father's nakedness..." As a result, interpreters have proposed a variety of possibilities as to what kind of transgression has been committed by Ham, including the possibility that maternal incest is implied. (Wikipedia)

9:22: Later we learn that **Ham** was also the father of Sodomites (Gen 10:19). This fact may mean that there was a lot involved beyond just observing **his father’s nakedness**: it may have been a sexual act with a senseless drunken father, the obvious signs of which the father has discovered only when he woke up (v. 24).

9:22: The majority of commentators, both ancient and modern, have felt that **Ham's seeing his father naked** was not a sufficiently serious crime to explain the punishment that follows. His brothers, however, take the episode seriously enough. 
The Targum Onqelos (translation of Torah into the Aramaic) has Ham gossiping about his father's drunken disgrace "in the street" (a reading which has a basis in the original Hebrew), so that being held up to public mockery was what had angered Noah.
The Babylonian Talmud (c. 500 AD) argues that Ham either castrated his father, or sodomised him. The same explanations are found in three Greek translations of the Bible, which replace the word "see" in verse 22 with another word denoting homosexual relations. 
(__[Wikipedia](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curse_of_Ham&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1582399365182000)__)

9:23: The response of Shem and Japheth is in sharp contrast to Ham’s actions, as the brothers honor their father despite his foolish behavior. (ESV)

9:24: The designation of Ham as the **youngest son** is peculiar, given that he is always listed after Shem and before Japheth. Possibly, for some unexplained reason, the traditional order of names does not reflect the birth sequence of the boys. (ESV)

9:24: The medieval commentator Rashi writes that the son was not “youngest” but “small” (הקטן), the ‘defective’ one and the 'disgraceful' one. '**small'** does not mean 'the youngest' since Ham was older than Shem. (Wikipedia)

9:25: Biblical scholar Philip R. Davies explains that the author of this narrative used **Noah** to **curse** **Canaan**, in order to provide justification for the later Israelites driving out and enslaving the Canaanites. (Wikipedia)

9:25: **Canaan** was Ham's fourth son. Noah’s curse does not target the offender, but one specific child of Ham

9:25: Dead sea scrolls explain that since Ham had already been blessed by God (Genesis 9:1), he could not now be cursed by Noah. 
Josephus argued that Noah refrained from cursing Ham because of his nearness of kin, and so cursed Ham's son instead.
The book of Jubilees explains further that Noah had allocated Canaan a land west of the Nile along with his brothers, but that he violated this agreement and instead chose to squat in the land delineated to Shem (and later Abraham), and so rightly deserved the curse of slavery.
Another interpretation was that Noah's "youngest son" could not be Ham, who was the middle son: "for this reason they say that this youngest son was in fact Canaan, who had in fact been the first to see Noah, and had then gone and told his father, who then told his brothers in the street.
According to one legend preserved in the Babylonian Talmud, God cursed Ham because he broke a prohibition on sex aboard the ark and "was smitten in his skin". This tradition explainins dark skin as the result of a curse on Ham.
(__[Wikipedia](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curse_of_Ham&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1582399365183000)__)

9:25: This passage was wrongly appealed to in past centuries to justify the enslavement of African people, resulting in grievous abuse, injustice, and inhumanity to people created in the image of God. Noah’s curse of Canaan, which focuses on his being a servant, anticipates the judgment that will later befall the Canaanites (Deut. 7:1–3: “When the LORD your God brings you into the land … and clears away many nations before you, [the descendants of Canaan], then you must devote them to complete destruction. You shall make no covenant with them and show no mercy to them. You shall not intermarry with them”). (ESV)

9:25: While Genesis 9 never says that Ham was black, he became associated with black skin, through folk etymology deriving his name from a similar, but actually unconnected, word meaning "dark" or "brown". (Wikipedia)

9:27: **Shem** is given pride of place, as is implied by Noah’s remark that **Japheth** will dwell in the tents of **Shem**. Shem is first, Japheth is second, but both will prosper. (ESV)




















### The Table of Nations

10: In general, the descendants of Ham settled in North Africa and the eastern Mediterranean coast, the descendants of Shem in Mesopotamia and Arabia, and the descendants of Japheth in Europe and the greater area of Asia Minor. (ESV)

10:6: **Ham** is the **father** of Philistia, **Egypt**, Assyria, Nineveh, and other enemies of Israel. He is the father of **Sodom**, **Canaan** and other nations which are seen in the Bible as base and sinful.

10:6: **Ham’s** descendants receive considerably more attention than those of Japheth and Shem. Among them figure many of Israel’s enemies, such as the **Egyptians**, Babylonians, Philistines, and various **Canaanite** groups. (ESV)

10:9: **Nimrod** is linked to the great cities of Babel (i.e., Babylon; see note on 11:9) and Nineveh in Assyria, whose inhabitants at a later stage would descend in destructive power on the kingdoms of Israel and Judah. (ESV)

10:21: These are the people with whom Israelites felt the most affinity, for Abraham was descended from **Shem**. Insofar as they can be identified, many of these are Arabian tribes or kingdoms. (ESV)

10:21: **Eber** is mentioned even before Shem’s own sons are named. The designation “Hebrew” (Hb. ‘ibri; see 14:13) is derived from “**Eber**” (Hb. ‘eber). (ESV)




















### The Tower of Babel

11:4: It is commonly believed that a Ziggurat was being built in the Tower of Babel episode: a monumental temple-tower with stairways ascending to the top of the structure where a small temple/shrine sat on the summit. They were commonly built of sun-dried mud and straw bricks held in position with bitumen as mortar, and the text indicates that the builders of Babel had discovered the process of making mud bricks and that they employed “**bitumen for mortar**”. Based on that invention, the builders decided “to build … a tower with its top in the heavens”. (ESV)

11:4: Clearly nothing was wrong with the **city** and the **tower** itself: God was not going to delegitimize skyscrapers! There was definitely something wrong with the reasons why the tower was built, with its purpose or meaning, and originally, with the hearts of the men that have decided to build that tower, and their combined effort in achieving that wicked purpose, whatever it was. And it was wicked no doubt, judging by God’s reaction, and remembering that “the intention of man's heart is evil from his youth” (Gen 8:21).

11:4: This episode is significantly more important than its length suggests. It presents a unified humanity using all its resources to establish **a city** that is the antithesis of what God intended when he created the world. The tower is a symbol of human autonomy, and the city builders see themselves as determining and establishing their own destiny without any reference to the Lord. (ESV)

11:4: The purpose of building the **city**: in order not to be **dispersed**; the purpose of building a tower: to **make a name** for themselves. The ultimate goals were security and praise. (ESV)

11:4: The Babel enterprise is all about human independence and self-sufficiency apart from God. The **builders** believe that they have no need of God. Their technology and social unity give them confidence in their own ability. (ESV)

11:4: Contrary to God’s plan that people should fill the earth, the city-building project is designed to prevent the population from being **dispersed** over the face of the whole earth. (ESV)

11:6: Here **God** clarifies His reasoning: it’s not only that something unacceptable was going on at that moment; it’s the path that the humans have taken that would lead them to even worse things.

11:7: Acknowledging the potential danger of a unified, self-confident humanity (v. 6), God intervenes by **confusing their language** so that they cannot understand one another. This has the desired effect of dispersing the people throughout the world. (ESV)

11:9: **Babel** is also the name used in the OT for the city of Babylon. As a city, Babylon symbolizes humanity’s ambition to dethrone God and make the earth its own (see Revelation 17–18). (ESV)




















### Shem’s Descendants

11:28: **Ur** was a city with a highly developed urban culture. (ESV)

11:31: **Terah** has decided to leave **Ur** and move to **Canaan**, the land where, as the reader knows, Hebrews are ultimately supposed to settle. It’s not clear why Terah has decided to leave **Ur,** and why he has decided to **go into the land of Canaan**, but it happened only after Haran died (v. 28). Whatever the purpose was, in the middle of the road Terah has changed his mind, and the family has **settled** in **Haran**, “**settled**” meaning that he had no intention of travelling any further. He lived there until he died; it was **Abram** who continued the journey at the Lord’s prompting.

11:31: **Haran** is a region in the northern Mesopotamia and was an important crossroads and commercial center in the ancient Near East. This location in Turkey is now called Eskiharran, “old Harran”. (ESV)

11:31: The spelling of the town name “**Haran**” in Hebrew is quite distinct from the name of Terah’s third son. (ESV)

11:32: If Abram was born when **Terah** was 70 years old (see v. 26), and if Abram was 75 years old when he departed for Canaan (see 12:4), then Terah **died** 60 years after Abram’s departure. 
In Acts 7:4, however, Stephen says that Abram left **Haran** after the **death** of **Terah**. A simple way to resolve the chronological difficulty is to suppose that Stephen was following an alternative text (represented today in the Samaritan Pentateuch), which says that **Terah died** at the age of 145. (ESV)




















### The Call of Abram

12:1: God calls **Abram** to continue the journey that Terah, his father, had started but did not complete. (ESV)

12:1: **God** calls **Abram** to leave his **country** and his **kindred** in part because *they were pagan*. Josh 24:2-3: “Your fathers lived beyond the Euphrates, Terah, the father of Abraham and of Nahor; *and they served other gods*. Then I took your father Abraham from beyond the River and led him through all the land of Canaan, and made his offspring many.”.

12:1: The divine speech that suddenly and unexpectedly introduces this section is exceptionally important, for it sets the agenda not only for **Abram’s** life but also for his descendants. The repetition of the verb **bless** (vv. 2-3) underscores the hope that through Abram people everywhere may experience God’s favor, reversing the predominantly negative experience of chs. 3–11. (ESV)

12:1: **God’s** invitation to **Abram** challenges him to abandon the normal sources of personal identity and security: his family and **country**. To obey, Abram must abandon all that he has and trust God implicitly; all human support is largely removed. The promised outcomes are conditional on Abram’s obedience. (ESV)

12:2: **God’s** purpose for **Abram**, that he become a great nation, stands in obvious tension with Sarai’s barrenness and the summons to leave his homeland. **Abram** is challenged by **God** to establish a new humanity. (ESV)

12:2: **make your name great**. This was the failed aspiration of the tower builders (11:4). (ESV)

12:3: Although **Abram** is called to be a **blessing** to others, much rests on how they treat him. Those who are positive toward Abram will experience God’s favor; the one who despises Abram will know God’s displeasure. (ESV)

12:4: The brief report of **Abram’s** response presents his obedience as immediate and unquestioning. (ESV)

12:4: Abram may have been responsible for **Lot** following the death of Haran (11:27–28). Since by this stage Lot is a wealthy adult with considerable possessions (vv. 5-6), readers may assume that he desires to support Abram’s mission. (ESV)

12:6: **Abram** probably camped away from urban populations; these locations are identified by distinctive natural features, e.g. **trees**. (ESV)

12:6: **Abram** camped away from **Canaanites**, who are mentioned in the verse.

12:7: **God** has **appeared** to Abram: this marvellous event must have made a deep impression on him, so he builds an **altar** in response to this event. The repeated words, **who had appeared to him**, may indicate that the altar commemorates the event.

12:7: Another source of joy for **Abram** is that God has implicitly promised that Abraham, who was already 75 and whose wife was barren, will have children. 

12:7: This is the first of a number of manifestations of **God** to the patriarchs. These are often associated with divine promises. On this occasion **God** promises the **land** to the descendants of **Abram**, although he is still childless. In response, Abram **builds an altar to the LORD**. (ESV)

12:9: **Negeb**. **Abram** moves further south, towards Egypt. (ESV)




















### Abram and Sarai in Egypt

12:13: The events described in this section raise many questions that go unanswered, creating a sense of ambiguity as to how the behavior of everyone involved should be judged. As is common in biblical stories, the narrator gives no direct evaluation of the participants’ actions, leaving the reader to figure out the ethical questions. (ESV)

12:13: Abram’s selfish actions imply that he thinks God is unable to protect him. Yet when the plan backfires, it is the Lord who rescues him. (ESV)

12:13: With the assumption that Abram actually loved his wife. Which he probably did, because when she died, he “mourned and weeped” (Gen 23:2).
Abram believes that the land he enters is godless (Gen 20:11: “Abraham said, “I did it because I thought, ‘There is no fear of God at all in this place, and they will kill me because of my wife.”) and he doesn’t trust God to rescue him (v. 12: “they will kill me, but they will let you live”), but rather, he devises his own ruse based on a half-truth even before he enters the city (v. 11: “When he was about to enter Egypt”; v. 13: “Say you are my sister”). The idea probably was that if everyone knows that she is his sister, no one would dare to take her by force (v. 13: “my life may be spared for your sake”): at worst, the Egyptians would propose to her, which he could safely reject. It is not known whether Abram’s judgment was correct: perhaps, there was no danger in Egypt at all. 
Abram must have spread the lie and lived peaceably for a while. It seemed that the plan worked fine and he had the situation under control: the Egyptians saw his wife, but did not take her from him (v. 14: “the Egyptians saw that the woman was very beautiful”). Many people must have known her to be his sister already, but could not have her.
However, something went horribly wrong: the lie that Abraham had spread finally went as far as the Pharaoh’s house (v. 15: “they praised her to Pharaoh”). Possibly, that was one special marriage proposal: a proposal from the Pharaoh himself, the most powerful person in the country, which could not be rejected. Also, it was too late for Abram to change his tune and say that this sister of his, as everyone already knew her, was actually his wife. 
The plan backfired: Abram was caught in his own lie and couldn’t disclose to the Pharaoh that he had been lying the whole time. He must have had a horrible dilemma: tolerate his beloved wife being with the Pharaoh and keep his life; or face the very thing he had feared: be killed if the truth is revealed. God did not let Abram’s deception work and has brought Abram to the very situation he had feared.
Again, Abram did not find the faith nor the courage to tell the truth and try to negotiate somehow. Perhaps, he did not even have that chance: how would anyone dare to approach the ruler of the country with a request to surrender his new wife? So Abram had to suffer the consequences. He must have hated every gift he has received from the Pharaoh for his wife that he has lost!
This was going on for a long while. The situation did not resolve overnight: Abram had to suffer the consequences for quite a while (v. 16: numerous gifts: “sheep, oxen, male donkeys, male servants, female servants, female donkeys, and camels.”). It is clear that Abram enjoyed none of the gifts he was sent. How could he!
After teaching Abram a hard lesson, God has acted and resolved the situation (v. 17: “afflicted Pharaoh and his house with great plagues”). The Pharaoh has somehow learned that Sarah was Abram’s wife (v. 18: “she was your wife”): either the Pharaoh had some sort of a dream, or a prophecy, or Abram has finally found the courage to tell the truth. 
By God’s mercy, Abram was not punished further, however, but received his wife back. Even though there’s no word in the text, Abram must have bitterly repented of his behavior after experiencing such a loss. 
It is notable that God did not abandon Abram, but helped him. In the end, Abram was even more blessed with possessions because of all those gifts that the family could now keep to themselves (v. 16: “he dealt well with Abram”)! God did not even let the Pharaoh approach her (likely from a parallel episode in Gen 20:4: “Now Abimelech had not approached her”).
God has taught Abram a lesson that when he does not trust God and take shortcuts, he may in the end face the very thing he fears most. Unfortunately, Abram did not learn the lesson and will take another shortcut later on when he fathers his first child with a concubine.

12:13: (translation) В предположении, что Аврам всё-таки любил свою жену (а они были много десятков лет вместе, и он очень скорбел и рыдал когда она умерла! (Быт 32:2)), я всё-таки думаю что Аврам не отдал её Фараону с холодным расчётом, легко пожав плечами; он был вынужден это сделать в результате греха, который привёл к катастрофическим последствиям. А на самом деле Бог через эту ситуацию преподал Авраму урок: обрати внимание, ведь в конце именно Бог всё возвращает на свои места!
Аврам был уверен, что страна, в которую он собирается прийти, - страна безбожников (Быт 20:11: "я подумал, что нет на месте сем страха Божия, и убьют меня за жену мою"), и он не мог довериться Богу, Который вёл его до сих пор. Он не верил, но боялся (ст. 12: "и убьют меня, а тебя оставят в живых"). Потому ещё до того, как войти в страну, Аврам придумывает обман, уловку (ст. 11: "Когда же он приближался к Египту"; ст. 13: "скажи же, что ты мне сестра"). План скорее всего был в том, что если все будут знать, что Сара - его сестра, то никто не осмелится взять её силой (ст. 13: "чтобы ради тебя меня приняли хорошо и, благодаря тебе, я остался бы жив."). В худшем случае, египтяне будут свататься к ней, а на все такие предложения легко можно давать отказ. Причём, неизвестно, правильно ли рассудил Аврам: возможно, в Египте вообще не было для них никакой опасности, даже несмотря на красоту Сары. Так как решение было принято ещё до входа в страну, он вообще мог ошибаться; но уже решился на обман.
Обман, похоже, удался: Аврам и Сара жили мирно некоторое время; и нет никаких сомнений, что много кому они уже успели сказать, что Сара - его сестра. Казалось, что ситуация полностью под контролем: египтяне видели Сару, считали её незамужней, но не забрали её (ст. 14: "Египтяне увидели, что она женщина весьма красивая"). 
Но кое-что пошло не так: обман Аврама дошёл и до дома фараона (ст. 15: "придворные фараона... расхвалили ее фараону"). Возможно, если Фараон заинтересовался женщиной, ему уже нельзя было отказать: это всё-таки самый могущественный человек в целой стране; таким не отказывают. Также Авраму уже было слишком поздно начинать петь другую песню: он уже всем рассказал, что она - сестра, и менять её статус на "жену" было уже слишком поздно. 
В итоге уловка, которую придумал Аврам для собственной безопасности, уловила его же самого: он уже не мог сказать фараону, что всё это время он врал. У Аврама, похоже, была ужасная дилемма: либо терпеть то, что его жена теперь живёт с фараоном, но при этом сохранить свою жизнь; либо сказать правду и оказаться перед лицом смерти, которой он так боялся. Получается, что Бог не позволил сработать обману Аврама, но привёл Аврама к той самой ситуации, которой он так боялся.
В этой ситуации снова оказалось, что у Аврама не было ни веры, ни смелости, сказать правду и попытаться как-то договориться и вернуть свою жену. Может быть, что у него и не было такой возможности: в самом деле, как подойти к правителю страны, в которой ты живёшь, требуя у него отдать его новую жену? Авраму пришлось принять на себя последствия своего решения.
Кроме того, что он потерял жену, он наверняка ненавидел каждый дар, который он за неё получал: весь этот скот, который ему дарили долгое время (ст. 16: "Аврам приобрел мелкий и крупный скот, ослов и ослиц, слуг и служанок, и верблюдов."). По числу даров понятно, что Сара прожила в доме фараона некоторое время, и у Аврама было время помучиться совестью и о многом пожалеть. 
Однако вот, что получается: Бог преподал Авраму тяжёлый урок, но Бог же Сам решает все проблемы (ст. 17: "Господь поразил фараона и весь его дом тяжелыми болезнями"). В конце концов, фараон как-то узнал, что Сара - жена Аврама (ст. 18: "она – твоя жена"): либо фараону было видение, или сон, или пророчество, или может, Аврам наконец нашёл в себе смелость признаться.
Ситуация напряжённая, но по Божьей милости, Авраму не пришлось нести наказание в полной мере: он всё-таки получает назад свою жену. Несмотря на то, что в тексте нет об этом ни слова, Аврам наверняка раскаялся о своих поступках после того, как ему пришлось пережить такую потерю.
Стоит также отметить, что Бог не покинул Аврама: напротив, Бог помог ему. В конце всей этой истории, Аврам оказывается благословлён ещё большими богатствами, потому что все подарки, что он получал, они теперь могут оставить в семье (ст. 16: "Он хорошо принял Аврама"). Бог даже не позволил фараону приблизиться к его жене (скорее всего следуем из Быт 20:4: "Но Авимелех не прикасался к ней"). 
Итак, Бог преподал Авраму урок, в результате которого он должен был научиться доверять Богу и не пытаться выкрутиться своими силами: потому что в итоге он может нарваться именно на то, чего боялся, и оказаться в ещё худшей ситуации. Увы, мы дальше узнаем, что Аврам не полностью усвоил этот урок, потому что в дальнейшем он снова попытается действовать своими силами: когда он зачнёт сына от служанки.

12:14: **Sarai** was 65 years old! How in the world could she be **beautiful** at such an age? The answer may lie in her skin color: it is possible that she was more light-skinned than the Egyptians, and therefore attractive to them.

12:16: The scarcity of **camels** in the period of the patriarchs made them a luxury of great worth, and thus their listing here (and elsewhere) may serve to emphasize Abram’s wealth. (ESV)

12:17:** Pharaoh’s** taking of **Sarai** brings divine punishment on him **and his house**. This event (plagues; cf. Ex. 11:1) prefigures the exodus from Egypt when God punishes another pharaoh for his mistreatment of Abram’s descendants. (ESV)




















### Abram and Lot Separate

13:1: **Abram** did not leave **Egypt** voluntarily: after the situation around his wife, they were expelled from Egypt (12:20: “sent him away”).

13:1: After waiting through the famine in **Egypt** for a while, **Abram** went north again, to the same region of **Negeb**, and then even further north (v. 3). Unlike the people of Canaan, Abram’s family has returned with more possessions that they had had. In fact, they were very, very wealthy (v. 6: the land couldn’t even sustain their livestock).

13:10: Abram had given **Lot** the right to choose, and Lot chose a land that looked best. But danger is already looming over Lot: even though the **well-watered land** is almost like the **garden of the Lord**, this fertile land would soon become home to such wickedness that **the Lord** himself would destroy it.
It must be to emphasize the futility of Lot’s choice that the author has chosen to remind the reader of the fate of **Sodom** in this verse. It must be that Lot chose the land himself, without inquiring God about the best choice. **Abram, **however, has inquired (v. 4: “called upon the name of the Lord”).

13:10: This remark is probably given to inform the reader that the land that he knows is currently barren used to be fertile in the times before **Sodom and Gomorrah** were **destroyed** with fire and brimstone, which may have adversely affected the suitability of this area for flocks and herds. (ESV)

13:13: Lot has chosen the land that was fertile, but was also home to **great wickedness**. The side note given here probably hints at the unreasonableness of Lot’s choice which was done not by faith but by sight.

13:12-13: At first Lot may not have known what sort of people lived in **Sodom** (v. 13: “wicked”, “great sinners”), but we also see that he used to live in tents (v. 12: “moved his tent”) at first, and moved closer and closer to **Sodom**. Lot is later found living in the city (Gen 14:12), having abandoned his tent-dwelling lifestyle. This move indicates that he willingly chose to live among those wicked people, perhaps, for the sake of his business or comfort.

13:14: Even though the land that **Abram** was left with did not look that good, it was the land on which **the Lord** promises that Abram’s descendants will live and become a great nation. A choice that seems to be inferior may become superior by God’s power for a person who follows God’s guidance and not his own wisdom. 

13:16: God promises Abram numerous **offspring**. At this stage, Abram still has no children. (ESV)

13:18: A cuneiform tablet discovered there from this time period indicates that **Hebron** was a capital city of a Canaanite kingdom. (ESV)

13:18: Repeated mentions of **building altars to the Lord** indicates that even though **Abram’s** faith had stumbled while in Egypt, he worships God. This involves trusting God and following Him now, especially remembering that it was by God’s mercy that he’s received his wife back.




















### Abram Rescues Lot and is blessed by Melchizedek

14:2: **Sodom and Gomorrah** is precisely the place where Lot has settled after separating with Abraham. The area is now invaded by an alliance of four kings who defeat a local confederation of five kings and take Lot captive. (ESV)

14:3: Such alliances were a common and recurring aspect of politics in the ancient Near East. (ESV)

14:13: This is the first occurrence of the term “**Hebrew**” in the Bible and is probably used here to denote the ethnicity of **Abram** (ESV)

14:15: A **nighttime** assault gives **Abram** an advantage. (ESV)

14:15: This episode provides an interesting insight into his future aspirations in light of God’s promises of the land. Although **Abram** can compete militarily against powerful kings, he rejects the use of power to achieve God’s purpose. Thus he does not use force to take control of the land of Canaan. The patriarch will not adopt violent strategies in order to obtain it. (ESV)

14:18: **Melchizedek** (which means “king of righteousness”; Heb. 7:2: “He is first, by translation of his name, king of righteousness, and then he is also king of Salem, that is, king of peace.”) generously provides a meal for the returning victors. (ESV)

14:18: **Salem** is possibly a shortened version of “Jerusalem” (Ps. 76:2: God’s “abode has been established in Salem”) and is related to *shalom*, the Hebrew word for “peace”. (ESV)

14:18: **Melchizedek** is then a **priest-king** of Jerusalem. There appears to have been an expectation that later **kings of Jerusalem** should resemble him (Ps. 110:4: “You are a priest forever after the order of Melchizedek.”). The book of Hebrews presents Jesus Christ, from the royal line of David, as belonging to the “order of Melchizedek” and therefore superior to the Levitical priests (Heb. 5:5–10: ““You are a priest forever, after the order of Melchizedek.“; 6:20–7:17). (ESV)

14:18: **God Most High**: Heb. *’El ‘Elyon*. (ESV)

14:20: Melchizedek’s blessing attributes Abram’s victory to the power of **God**. By giving a **tenth**, **Abram** affirms the truthfulness of Melchizedek’s words. (ESV)

14:23: **Abram** affirms that he is depending on God and not on human kings or their gifts in order to become a “great nation” and acquire a great name. (ESV)




















### God’s Covenant with Abram

15:1: **After these things.** **Abram** rejected the offer from the king of Sodom for the victory spoils as a reward. In response, God now states that Abram’s reward shall be very great. By rejecting the use of human wealth to achieve greatness, Abram demonstrates his willingness to wait for God to provide. (ESV)

15:2: **Eliezer** (means, God is help) is a trusted member of Abram’s household, possibly a slave, who came from **Damascus**. (ESV)

15:6: Faith in God entails trust in or confident reliance on God, based on the truthfulness of his words, and it will lead to obeying his commands. A person’s faith, or lack of it, is most apparent in crises such as Abram was facing. **He believed God** would give him a son despite many years of childlessness. (ESV)

15:6: “**Righteousness**” is the fundamental OT virtue characterized by a godly life lived in conformity with the law. It is the righteous who enjoy God’s favor. Abram has proved himself righteous by his deeds, he is counted (that is, regarded) as righteous because of his faith. (ESV)

15:10: This is possibly a type of oath that makes a party who breaks it like one of those dead animals (Jer 34:18-19: “the men who transgressed ... I will make them like the calf that they cut in two and passed between its parts”). In this case, it is God Who’s giving the deadly oath. (ESV)

15:10: Another interpretation is that the sacrificial animals symbolize Abram’s descendants (all of Israel), the “birds of prey” signify their enemies (unclean nations), and the “fire pot” and “torch” represent God’s presence. (ESV)

15:16: **Amorites** were the descendants of Ham (Gen 10:16). The Amorites will be dispossessed of their land as an act of divine punishment. At that time, their accumulated iniquity will be so great that God will no longer tolerate their presence in the land. (ESV)

15:18: God unconditionally pledges that Abram’s offspring will possess this land. (ESV)




















### Sarai and Hagar

16:1: Years and years have passed after God has first promised Abram **children**, and 11 years have passed after Abram settled in Canaan, and Sarai was unable to bear any children to Abram. No doubt, they have tried, but she was barren (Gen 11:30). Abram’s confidence must have faded, because everything looked like it was impossible to have children with her. Especially after all these years. Especially considering their age. Impossible.

16:2: Even though it was **The Lord** Who has promised **children** to Abram, Sarai emphasized that it was the same **Lord** Who **prevented her from bearing children**. She either was bitter with the Lord and so blamed Him with being unable to deliver His promise, or she thought that they are to achieve the promise by themselves. Either way, that was a lack of faith. 

16:2: **Abram** had previously refused to pursue God’s promises by his own means: he did not think that the promised land is his anyway and so he’s free to take it by force; He had waited on the Lord to deliver the land to him. But when it came to **children**, he didn’t trust the Lord anymore and **listened to the voice** of his wife.

16:2: **Bearing a child** on behalf of a barren woman was a custom mentioned in other ancient Near Eastern texts. (ESV)

16:3: Hagar’s status within Abram’s household is changed from servant to **wife**, although this does not place her on a par with Sarai (see note on 25:5–6). While the OT records occasions when particular individuals have more than one wife, such instances are almost always fraught with complications and difficulties. (ESV)

16:4: **Hagar’s** ability to conceive causes her to **look down on** Sarai. (ESV)

16:5: **Sarai** initially directs her anger at **Abram**, who acquiesces in the situation, permitting Sarai to deal **harshly** with Hagar. The human solution to Sarai’s barrenness creates new problems. (ESV)

16:5: It is clear from this episode that trying to achieve God’s will by human means leads to problems, not to blessedness. God will do His will in His time; not in our time.

16:7: Hagar’s flight takes her in the direction of Egypt, her homeland. (ESV)

16:7: By sending an **angel-messenger**, the Lord persuades Hagar to return, probably thus leading Abram to think that the child soon to be born, Ishmael, might indeed be the promised son (Gen 16:7: “Abraham said to God, “Oh that Ishmael might live before you!””) (ESV).

16:7: Theologically, this episode emphasizes the hearing and seeing nature of God, and his mercy. (ESV)

16:9: Hagar is commanded by God to transform her attitude toward her **mistress**, Sarai; instead of despising her, she is to **submit to her** authority. (ESV)

16:10: God gives **Hagar** the very same promise He has given to Abram: **offspring** so numerous that **they cannot be numbered**.

16:15: By naming **Ishmael**, **Abram** publicly acknowledges him as his son and heir. (ESV)

16:16: Ishmael is born 11 years after Abram settled in the land of Canaan (ESV)




















### Abraham and the Covenant of Circumcision

17:1: **Ninety nine years old** is 13 after the birth of Ishmael. (v. 25: “Ishmael was 13 years old”)

17:1: To **walk before God** and to **be blameless** is the invitation to a holy living, to a righteous life. 

17:1: **God Almighty** (Heb. *El Shaddai*). The second word highlights a particular attribute of God*; El Shadday* emphasizes God’s power, which in this context will enable Sarai to bear Abram a son. (ESV)

17:1: Two closely related instructions are given to Abram, challenging him (1) **to walk before God**: to maintain an *ongoing* relationship with God; (2) **to be blameless**: to be faultless or perfect. (ESV)

17:1: Unlike the covenant made in ch. 15, this covenant has a conditional dimension which explicitly  indicates that this covenant will benefit only those who walk before God and are blameless. (ESV)

17:2: Abram has already had his faith counted to him as righteousness; now, God is going to make a conditional covenant, based on righteousness.

17:3: **Abram falling on his face** is worship, but also a positive response to God offering a covenant.

17:6: The promise of **making Abraham exceedingly fruitful** echoes the the divine blessing given at creation (1:28) and later repeated to Noah after the flood (9:1). Through this covenant the negative effects of the fall will ultimately be reversed; and in this, Abraham is another Adam, the beginning of something new. (ESV)

17:10: **Circumcision** is not a Hebrew invention. For example, it was used in Egypt from very early periods as an act of ritual purity. (ESV)

17:11: **Circumcision** is a mark that exists, but is not normally visible to others. (ESV)

17:12: **Eight days**. It is of significant medical importance that male circumcision be carried out on the eighth day after birth since the level of vitamin K is highest on this day and vitamin K plays a pivotal role in regulation and control of the important clotting factors in the coagulation pathway that helps in stopping bleeding. The  Vitamin  K  and  Thrombocin  (which  is  a blood clotter) are the highest  in a  baby on his eighth day of life, and together with prothrombin, are essential  for  the function  of  several proteins  involved in blood coagulation. It is essential that circumcision is done on that very day. (Sokoto Journal of Medical Laboratory Science 2017; 2(3): 91 –  94 Original Research)

17:12: Перевод.Про обрезание на 8-й день. Очень важно с медицинской точки зрения, чтобы обрезание было совершено именно на восьмом дне от рождения младенца, потому что именно в этот день содержание витамина K в крови достигает своего пика, а этот витамин играет важнейшую роль в свёртывании крови: процессе, который останавливает кровотечение. Ни до восьмого дня, ни после него, организм младенца не способен столь эффективно перенести обрезание, как именно в восьмой день. (Исследование, опубликованное в медицинском журнале Сокото, 2017 год)

17:14: **Cut off**. Circumcision distinguished those who believed in the importance of the divine promises to Abraham from those who did not. (ESV)

17:17: **Abraham laughed**. His wife has been barren his whole life. It was quite natural for Abraham to laugh at the thought of them having a child.

17:18: **Abraham** still believed God, but he must have thought that **Ishmael** is the promised son.

17:19: There are four kinds of **Abraham’s offspring**:
1. *Natural offspring*: Ishmael, Isaac, the sons of Keturah, and their children
2. Natural offspring, *children of the promise*: only Isaac
3. *Promised offspring*: A distinctive line of offspring, starting earlier with Seth and continuing through Noah, Abraham, Isaac, Israel, and David, culminating in Jesus Christ.
4. *Spiritual offspring*: Those united with Christ (the promised offspring). Jews and Gentiles who trust in the Messiah.
(ESV)

17:19: **Isaac** means “he laughs”. There is a recurring motif of **laughter** around him: first, Abraham, then, Sarah (Gen 18:12) — out of unbelief; but then Sarah laughs again when Isaac is born, but this time — out of joy (Gen 21:6); and Ismael 

17:19: God **establishes a covenant with him**, namely, with Isaac: the son born by God’s power, not by Abraham’s power.

17:20: The covenant is *established* with Isaac, but Ishmael also gets *some* of the blessings of the covenant. (ESV)

17:21: God has promised children to Abraham many times, but this is the first time that any timeframe was given.

17:23: The urgency with which **Abraham** circumcises the whole house **that very day** demonstrates that he did not only take God’s words seriously, but it was of utmost importance to him.




















### Isaac's Birth Promised

18:1: It’s been *years* since Abraham settled at the **oaks of Mamre**, but he is still dwelling in a **tent** (ESV).

18:2: Abraham’s actions (**ran, bowed, “Lord”, “servant”**) shows that he viewed the men as exceptionally important and worthy of great respect. (ESV)

18:3: **O Lord**. How did Abraham recognize that these three were not merely human?

18:3: **O Lord**. In Hebrew, Abraham properly says *Adonai*, which is used for God in the OT. Had he greeted a human, he would have said *Adoni*, “my lord”, which has a slightly different spelling. No doubt, Abraham has recognized that these visitors are a divine manifestation. This explains Abraham’s part in the conversation of vv.22-33.(ESV)

18:4: Although Abraham speaks of **Little water and a morsel of bread,** he proceeds to prepare a substantial meal. (ESV)

18:8: **He stood by them**, assuming the role of a humble servant. Abraham did not eat with them, but waited on them.

18:8: **The Lord** clearly had no need for food, but by dining at Abraham’s place, God honored him.

18:9: Strangely enough, **Sarah** was not present while such honored guests were present, and **Abraham** must have served them himself. 
In v.10 we see that Sarah has interest in the guests (“listening at the tent door”). In v.13, the Lord talks about Sarah, knowing her thoughts, and in v.15 she engages in the conversation. 
So, either Sarah was in the tent but still visible from the dining place, or she must have come out of the tent to say the words to the Lord.
Either way, she was not at the table.

18:12: **Sarah laughed**. She has been barren her whole life. It was quite natural for Sarah to laugh at the thought of her having a child in her nineties.

18:12: Even though **Sarah laughed** to herself, she honored her husband by calling him **lord**, which indicated her pattern of submitting to and obeying her husband. (1 Pet 3:6: “as Sarah obeyed Abraham, calling him **lord**”). (ESV)

18:13: Even though **Sarah** was away from the table, **The Lord** knew that she had laughed *to herself*, and spoke to Abraham about it.

18:14: **Is anything too hard for the Lord** God almighty?

18:15: It is clear that **Sarah** responded even though no one spoke to her personally. The whole time, God spoke exclusively to Abraham, addressing him personally, and talking with him about his wife in the third person.

18:15: **Sarah denied** that she **did laugh**, and it was a lie she said to the Lord’s face. As often in the OT, the author does not judge, but merely reports. Even though it was **out of fear**, it is clear in this episode that Sarah exhibits her sin nature by denying the responsibility just like the first couple did before God. But God knows the truth: “**no, but you did laugh**”.
At the same time, **Sarah** had faith, because it is “by faith [that she has] received power to conceive” (Heb 11:11).

18:19: God’s **promise** is conditional upon **Abraham**’s descendants’ **keeping the way of the Lord**, and that is, **by doing righteousness and justice**: something that the believing Jews of the distant future will forget.




















### The Destruction of Sodom

18:21: These words reveal that the decision to destroy the cities of the plain was undertaken with careful scrutiny of the evidence. All that is implied is God’s direct attention to the matter. (ESV)

18:22: It is now clear from this verse, and from 19:1, that only one of the **men** was **The Lord**, but the other two were angels (19:1: “the two angels”). They now separate: angels** went toward Sodom**, but **the Lord** remained, with **Abraham standing before **Him.

18:22: Note that in 18:21 God had said that “I will go down”. He did not change His mind between the verses; as often in the OT, angels often speak and act for God, and God is often represented by angels who can give a direct speech on God’s behalf, using an “I” that stands for “I, God”.
Here, it is clear that God sends angels to see and to act, and angels act and speak as if God Himself acts and speaks through them. So loyal they are that they completely identify with Him.

18:23: **Abraham’s** intercession for the Gentile cities of Sodom and Gomorrah is in line with his calling to be the vehicle of blessing to the whole world. (ESV)

18:25: **Abraham** couldn’t believe that God, who has just promised to carefully evaluate the evidence (v.21), will so plainly go against His Own Nature of a **just judge**.

18:25: **Abraham** knows, he knows, that **God** must be true to His nature. (ESV)

18:25: It is clear that Abraham does not see God merely being in a position of a **judge**, but he sees God as a **just judge**, doing what is right. God will never misuse His power, but will always do what is right.

18:26: Abraham has just said what may be seen as outspoken questioning of the sovereign Lord and indignation at what he thought was about to happen. “**Far be it from you**!” does not sound like something you say to God.
Interestingly, **The Lord** does not rebuke such a blunt statement, but **answers**. After all, God Himself opened the possibility for that conversation by deciding to reveal to Abraham what He was about to do (v. 17).

18:27: **Abraham** speaks those words of humility before God whom he dared to question. When he had first asked God, there was no humility, but rather, questioning. 
Perhaps, now Abraham’s indignation has settled down, and he started talking the way he should have from the very beginning. Perhaps this is why God was so patient with Abraham’s outburst: God who knows the future surely knows that Abraham did not mean what his words looked like.

18:32: From the following events it becomes clear that there were not even **ten righteous people** in the town of Sodom. At least, those that were there, God has led away from the city, for He has promised that He will not destroy the righteous with the wicked.

18:32: Abraham does not dare to keep reducing the number, although logically, there must have been the final question: “What about if there is one rigteous person in the city; will you destroy the righteous with the wicked?”

18:32: Abraham may have ceased engaging in the conversation out of reverence, or maybe, because the principle has already been established: God will not punish the righteous along with the wicked.

18:33: **The Lord** does not go to Sodom, but **went his way**: left the place altogether. Only the two angels reached Sodom.

18:33: **Abraham** also returned to his place. It is notorious that he did not go to see what would happen to Sodom. He has just talked with God Himself, he still trusts Him, and trusts so much that there is no need to go and see for yourself. If the Lord has said, “I will not destroy the wicked with the righteous”, then it will be so. (Gen 15:6: “he believed the LORD, and jhe counted it to him as righteousness”). 

19:1: Three men had come to the Abraham’s place (Gen 18:2), and Abraham had called them “The Lord”. Now, only **two men** remain, and they’re called **angels**.

19:1: **In the evening.** God has come to Abraham “in the heat of the day” (18:1). In the evening *of the same day* the angels have arrived to Sodom.

19:1: Lot’s **sitting at the gate** means he was in a high esteem in the city: a decision-maker of sorts.

19:1: **Lot**’s actions closely mirror the reaction of Abraham: he immediately recognized that those guests were special, and **bowed down** to them, even though they were complete strangers.

19:2: There are numerous parallels between how Abraham and Lot greet his visitors: greets them politely, offers hospitality, prepares a meal, and there’s no report of his wife assisting. By resembling Abraham, Lot demonstrates that he is righteous. (ESV)

19:3: **Pressed them strongly**. Angels refused, but let Lot convince themselves. Had they refused only to let him be insistent? Or did they give in to his pressure?

19:3: **Unleavened bread**. The same bread that Israelites will eat when leaving Egypt. Since Lot is going to leave Sodom, this may be an allusion to the upcoming exodus.

19:3: **Unleavened bread**. Implies that it was baked in haste. (ESV)

19:4: **Before they lay down**. The news about the newcomers have spread quickly: it was “evening” (v. 1) when they came. It took the whole city a few hours to spread the news, decide, and gather **all the people to the last man**. Was it customary to greet strangers like this? Perhaps, Lot knew about this custom, and this was one of the reasons why he had invited those angels?

19:4: **All the people** have become a gang seeking an orgy of rape. (ESV)

19:5: **Know them** denotes sexual intercourse (cf. v. 8: “have not *known* any man”). (ESV)

19:5: **Know them**. Lot’s earlier insistence (v. 3) that the visitors should not spend the night in the square indicates that he feared for their safety. (ESV)

19:7: **Brothers**. By addressing some of the people as **brothers**, he is showing his connection with them. Even though he does not participate in their wickedness to the same extent, Lot has gotten attached to the city and its people. Perhaps, there were some close friends whom he called **brothers**.

19:8: **Let me bring you my daughters**. In desperation he offers his two unmarried daughters as substitutes: a shocking, cowardly, and inexcusable act (even if he intended this only as a bluff, or expected the offer to be rejected). The reaction of the crowd only confirms the truly evil nature of their intentions. (ESV)

19:8: **Let me bring you my daughters**. In Judg 19:24, Gibeah offered his concubine to a gang of worthless people looking for gay sex at the threshold of his house. She died from that abuse, but the husband did not seem to care.

19:8: **Let me bring you my daughters**. It is true, of two evils we must choose the less, but of two sins we must choose neither, nor ever do evil that good may come of it. (Benson commentary)

19:8: **Only do nothing to these men**. Lot’s exhibits perverted judgment: he sees great evil in sodomy, but sees only a lesser, an acceptable perhaps, evil, in the abuse of his both daughters. His actions flow from great charity: a strong desire to protect his guests, even in the face of danger; but due to some perverted judgment, Lot’s love results in a most imprudent and sinful motion, whereby he yielded to one sin to prevent another, contrary to Romans 3:8 (“Let us do evil that good may come? … Their condemnation is just.”).

19:12: (__Lot’s righteousness__) The NT tells us that **Lot** was a righteous man (2 Peter 2:7-8: “righteous man…, he was tormenting his righteous soul over their lawless deeds that he saw and heard”). This also clear here because God has promised not to destroy the righteous with the wicked, so He warns the righteous.

19:12: (__Lot’s righteousness__) **Lot** was righteous only relatively; and though his soul was daily vexed by what he saw, it was not vexed enough to make him quit such evil surroundings, and return to the healthy and virtuous life of the mountains. And, when finally he sought refuge in them, as it was not of his own free will, but on compulsion (v. 30). 
The warning of his fall is, that men who part with religious privileges for the sake of worldly advantage are in danger of sinking into moral degradation, and of losing, with their faith and hope, not only their self-respect and happiness, but even that earthly profit for the sake of which they sacrificed their religion.
(Ellicott's Commentary)

19:12: While **Lot** was righteous, some of his family were not (cf. the conduct or his daughters in v.32). God still gave Lot the possibility to take the whole family with him. Why?
First of all, it was a test: if Lot had a particular dislike for one of his in-laws, he might have had a temptation to leave that person behind. But Lot went out to want his sons-in-law (v. 14).
Secondly, family ties: God recognizes that family ties are important for a person, and offers Lot a possibility to take his unrighteous family with him, just as He let Noah take some of his unrighteous family members (i.e. Ham).
Thirdly, the possibility to witness a denial: God gives Lot the possibility to see for himself how his sons-in-law reject the salvation he offered (v. 14). It may well be that it was not the first time that they mocked his faith in an invisible God. They would have taken Lot’s words seriously otherwise.

19:13: **The outcry against its people has become great**. It is a recurring theme in the Bible that before God takes action, the measure of sins has to exceed a certain threshold, “be complete”. (Gen 15:16: "the iniquity of the Amorites is not yet complete.”; Dan 8:23: “when the transgressors have reached their limit”).

19:14: Those two **sons-in-law** were unrighteous people, because they were ultimately destroyed together with the rest. Lot has given his daughters in marriage to unrighteous people.

19:15: **Your wife and your two daughters**. After Lot has heard the denial himself, **the angels** do not urge him to take them anymore. 

19:16: **But he lingered**. There is no doubt that that Lot has taken the warning seriously, for he was speaking about the looming doom to other people. There was something dear to him in this town that he could not leave that easily.
Whatever that was that held him, it was likely either sinful or foolish, because God has led his family out “**being merciful to him**”, which indicates forgiveness.

19:16: **But he lingered**. This verse may mean that it was not Lot himself who was **lingering**, but his daughters. After all, Lot had to convince them too: two young betrothed girls whose bridegrooms were to remain and die in the flames.
Thus, “he” may mean “them”, i.e. the whole family, just like “**they brought him out and set him outside the city**” means “they brought them and set them”.

19:17: **They brought them out**. By interchanging “him” and “them”, the text shows that the head of the family is identified with the whole family.

19:17: **Do not look back**. Another indication of some strong attachment that Lot has developed to that place or something in it.

19:21: **I grant you this favor**. God resolved to keep the town intact, even though the original plan was to destroy it. Some of the wicked go on living because of a single request of a righteous person.

19:21: **I grant you this favor**. This is a case of a righteous person interceding for the unrighteous, and God hearing the request.

19:22: **I can do nothing till you arrive there**. God cannot destroy the righteous with the wicked.

19:23: **The sun had risen**. The angels had come to Sodom in the evening (v. 1)

19:26: **Looked back**. She disobeyed God’s commandment, and in doing so, demonstrated her attachment to the city of the wicked. There was something in it that she loved even more than Lot had.

19:27: **To the place**. After having pleaded with **the Lord** for the righteous in Sodom, Abraham went home: he saw no reason to sit and wait, like Johan would have. The evening came, the night has passed, and only in the morning (v. 23) the destruction came.

19:28: **And he looked down**. He did not yet know for sure that Lot, his nephew, was alive. It was only by faith that he could believe that God wouldn’t destroy the whole city.

19:29: **God remembered Abraham and sent Lot out**. The Bible draws a clear connection between Abraham’s intercession for the righteous of Sodom and God’s saving of their lives. Even though Abraham’s pleading was in line with God’s own will, Abraham’s “prayer” was somehow counted.

19:21: **God remembered Abraham and sent Lot out**. This is a case of a righteous person interceding for another righteous person, and God fulfilling the request.

19:30: **Zoar**. This town, Zoar, was to be destroyed, and has only been saved due to Lot’s intercession. It is full of wicked people, just like Sodom. 

19:30: **Afraid to live in Zoar**. Why afraid? 1) Lot may have been afraid for his daughters’ chastity. 2) He was afraid that people may learn that he had played a role in the destruction of Sodom. 3) He simply feared that God’s judgment may proceed and consume Zoar as well.
The **fear** was sufficiently strong to drive the whole family into a distant **cave**.

19:31: **Not a man on earth to come in to us**. Why did they say so? 1) Looking at the smoking brimstone down in the valley, they may have thought that the whole world have come to an end. 2) They may have thought that Zoar would be destroyed as well. 3) There may have been something wrong with the men of Zoar. Homosexuals? 4) Lot may have prohibited them from looking at the men of Zoar, for they were wicked.

19:31: **Not a man on earth to come in to us**. Lot’s two daughters fear that the isolated location chosen by their father will prevent them from having husbands. (ESV)

19:38: **The Moabites** and **the ammonites** would become Israel’s enemies.

19:38: Throughout the Bible, **the Ammonites** and Israelites are portrayed as mutual antagonists. During the Exodus, the Israelites were prohibited by the Ammonites from passing through their lands. The Ammonites soon allied themselves with Eglon of Moab in attacking Israel. (Wikipedia)




















### Abraham and Abimelech

20:2: Sarah is pregnant, and **Abimelech’s** actions put in jeopardy the fulfillment of God’s promise to Abraham that Sarah will bear him a son. (ESV)

20:2: Evidently **Sarah** looked much younger than her real age. (ESV)

20:2: **Abimelech** means “my father is king,” appears to have been a common royal name. The same name is mentioned in ch. 26 (see note on 26:1–2) and is given to later biblical figures. (ESV)

20:4: **Had not approached her**. This episode emphasizes in a variety of ways the important point that Sarah has not had intercourse with the king; otherwise, Abimelech could be the father of the son born to Sarah. (ESV)

20:4-5: **Abimelech** must be a believer in **God**, because he calls Him **Lord** and talks about **integrity** and **innocence**: words of a man who can tell right from wrong.

20:6: God has orchestrated some circumstances that Abimelech did not lie with Sarah. He could already have.

20:7: **And all who are yours**. It is interesting how God is going to punish the whole kingdom for the sin of the king. This pattern proceeds through the OT, where the king is not only responsible for the kingdom, not only its representative, but also one with the kingdom — in both his vices and virtues.

20:7: **Abraham** is the first person called **a prophet** in the OT. (ESV)

20:7: The emphasis here is that **Abraham** can intercede on behalf of others. God wants a person to ask Him to do something, even though it is according to His will.

20:11: **No fear of God in this place**. Abraham now provides the reason he acted the same way in Egypt.

20:12: Abraham reveals now, for the first time, that his words were not complete lies, but half-truth. He knew, however, that his half-truth will be misleading to others.

20:13: **At every place to which we come**. This is the strategy they’ve chosen to employ in every land they visit. Even after the experience of Egypt, they did not learn not to act like that. Later, Abraham’s son does the very same thing.

20:11: **There is no fear of God at all in this place**. Abraham’s response betrays both his lack of faith in God and his misjudgment of the people of Gerar. The whole episode reveals that the king and his servants were God-fearing. (ESV)

20:15: **My land is before you**. Abraham had wronged **Abimelech**, but the king, who is innocent, shows generosity to Abraham. Kings’s actions contrast sharply with Abraham’s self-serving deception. (ESV)




















### The Birth of Isaac

21:1: **The LORD** had said, “I will surely return to you about this time next year, and Sarah your wife shall have a son.”. He did not just promise that she will conceive, but He promised *to return*. And He **visited** Sarah somehow, but no details are given. (Gen 18:10)

21:2: **In his old age** emphasizes that **Abraham** was not able to have children anymore, so the child was born by God’s miracle. Rom 4:19 says that “his own body … was as good as dead”.
Abraham, however, was able to have more children after Sarah died. Probably, God has permanently returned Abraham his fertility.

21:3: **Isaac**. God had said to call the son like that (Gen 17:19) because Sarah, who had been barren her whole life, **laughed** at God’s promise of a child in her old age.

21:4: **As God had commanded him**. Commanded one year before Isaac was born. **Abraham** now exhibits obedience to the Lord who has just made His promise a reality.

21:6: **Laughter** of disbelief has turned into a **laughter** of joy.

21:7: **Sarah**’s words emphasize the impossible nature of what God has just done. A miracle. Impossible.

21:8: **Weaned**. Isaac was 2 or 3 years old already.

21:9: **The son of Hagar** was already 16 years old at the time.

21:9: That **laughing** was some sort of evil mocking. Gal 4:29 say that the son of Hagar actually “persecuted him who was born”, meaning some sort of abuse and mistreatment. **Laughing** was probably just one of the many ways Ismael persecuted Isaac.

21:9: The word “**laughing**” is ambiguous, and possibly favors “mocking”. **Ishmael** was probably **making fun** of Isaac’s role as Abraham’s promised son. (ESV)

21:10: **Sarah** is being cruel, but protective of her own child.

21:10: Abraham’s desire to fulfill the Lord’s promise by his own means has already started to bring trouble.

21:11: **On account of his son**. Abraham still viewed Ishmael as his own firstborn son and heir, and so was **displeased** of the tension in the family. The inheritance of God’s promise is clearly the issue here, because in the following verse God’s explanation rests on the naming of Isaac as the firstborn, the son of the promise.

21:12: **do as she tells you**. While Abraham is reluctant to send Ishmael away, God reassures him that this is for the best. (ESV)

21:12: **Through Isaac shall your offspring be named**. Even though **Ishmael** is older than **Isaac**, God confirms that **Isaac** will take priority over Ishmael. The importance of this is picked up in Rom 9:7-8: “and not all are children of Abraham because they are his offspring, but “Through Isaac shall your offspring be named.” This means that it is not the children of the flesh who are the children of God, but the children of the promise are counted as offspring”. (ESV)

21:16: **The child** was already 16 years old.

21:17: **God heard the voice of the boy**. Although this passage avoids using his personal name, “Ishmael” means “God hears” (ESV)




















### A Treaty with Abimelech

21:22: **God is with you in all that you do**. No wonder: his house had been punished because of Sarah, and even God spoke to him personally saying that Abraham is a prophet. And now Abimelech sees an old man making children with an equally old lady, and attributing the glory for that to God! That man is full of miracles.

21:22: **God is with you in all that you do**. Abimelech attributes Abraham’s success to God. (ESV)

21:23: **Swear to me that you will not deal falsely**. After having been deceived by Abraham once, Abimelech does not trust Abraham completely. He does not know what might be on that man’s mind.
It is quite interesting: it seems that Abraham was not any sort of stained-glass saint. He clearly did not make an impression of man who can be trusted and would always do what is right. 
Abimelech needed an oath: a guarantee that is unbreakable because he sees how God acts.

21:25: Before sealing the treaty, **Abraham** raises the contentious issue of ownership of **a well**. The covenant or treaty was designed to prevent conflict between the two parties. (ESV)

21:25: It seems that Beersheba is here being established as the border, the point where Israel ends and Philistia starts. Abraham will swear that he will not deal falsely with Abimelech, but only after the issue with the land division is settled. The gift of seven ewe lambs to Abimelech confirms Abraham’s ownership of the well. 
After Abimelech agrees with the well belonging to Abraham, there is no contention anymore, and Abraham is ready to swear that oath. Then Abimelech “returned to the land of the Philistines” (v. 32).
Because Beersheba will mark the southern boundary of Israel, this episode may signify the first claiming of the land and the making of the first border.

21:31: The Hebrew words for “**seven**” (**sheba‘**) and “oath” (shebu‘ah) are similar, it could also mean “**well of the oath**.” Perhaps the name was chosen because it embraced both concepts. (ESV)

21:31: The town of **Beersheba**, located in the northern Negeb, became famous as marking the southern boundary of Israel. (ESV)

21:32: The use of the term “**Philistines**” here is generally taken to be anachronistic, since the name is normally associated with non-Canaanites from the Aegean region who inhabited southwest Canaan from about 1180 B.C. onward—nearly a thousand years after Abraham’s time. (In 1 Samuel the Philistines are portrayed as the main opponents of the Israelites.) In light of this, the term may be used here and elsewhere to replace an earlier, obscure term; Genesis contains various examples of such modernizations. (ESV)

21:33: **Everlasting God** (Hb. ’El ‘Olam). ’El = God, followed ‘Olam: the attribute “of everlastingness”. (ESV)




















### The Sacrifice of Isaac

22:1: **God tested Abraham**. Did He test Abraham because God needed more information about Abraham’s obedience in different situations? Surely not. God **tested Abraham** for his own sake: to purify him, to teach him something, to let him see and understand.
God did not need that test. Abraham did.

22:1: The genuineness of Abraham’s obedience to God is **tested**. While it is not unknown for God to test individuals, testing must be clearly distinguished from tempting. God does not tempt anyone to do evil (Jas 1:13: “ God cannot be tempted with evil, and he himself tempts no one”); he does, however, test the commitment of people (e.g., Ex. 15:25: “What shall we drink?”; 16:4: “grumbled against Moses”). (ESV)

22:1: **Here I am**. Abraham responds with readiness to listen and obey. So far, God has been patient with him and kind to him. However, the words that came must have made Abraham’s face turn pale.

22:2: **Your son, your only son, whom you love**. Triple emphasis on the tender attitude Abraham had for his son emphasizes the essence of the test.

22:2: **Your only son. **With the departure of Ishmael from Abraham’s household, Isaac had become Abraham’s **only son**. (ESV)

22:2: **Of which I shall tell you**. This statement makes the command incomplete: Abraham will have to accomplish the immediate task at hand (take his son to Moriah and prepare everything needed for a burnt offering), but still be expecting further instructions. Abraham set off in an expectation of another word, knowing that he won’t be left without guidance.

22:2: **Moriah**. According to 2 Chron. 3:1, Solomon constructed the temple on Mount Moriah in Jerusalem. Also,  It requires about two days to travel on foot from Beersheba to Jerusalem (v. 4: “on the third day). (ESV)

22:3: **Abraham **displays remarkable trust in God, especially when the death of Isaac would appear to contradict all that God had promised to Abraham.

22:3: **Rose early in the morning**. The lack of any other comment Indicates Abraham’s readiness to fulfill what God has just commanded.  Heb 11:17 says that Abraham did it “by faith”, because “He considered that God was able even to raise him from the dead” (Heb 11:19).

22:4: **On the third day**. For three days straight Abraham was confident that he will have to kill “his son, his only son, whom he loves”.

22:4: **On the third day**. Elsewhere, two days also represents the time set aside to prepare for a special encounter with God on the third day (Ex 19:11: “be ready for the third day. For on the third day gthe LORD will come down on Mount Sinai in the sight of all the people”). Perhaps this sets the pattern for the significant “third day” (Mt 16:21, 1 Cor 15:4: “be killed and raised on the third day”). (ESV)

22:5: **Stay here**. Abraham left them behind because he did not want them to see what was going to happen. He was absolutely ready to sacrifice his own son, if that is what his God wanted. 
**Will come again to you**. However, Abraham was also confident that both of them will return. This is why the author of Hebrews confidently says that Abraham thought “God was able even to raise him from the dead” (Heb 11:19).

22:6: **Laid the wood on Isaac**. Isaac carrying the wood for his own sacrifice is a type of Christ carrying the cross for his own crucifixion.

22:6: **He took the knife**. Abraham couldn’t give the weapon to a person whom he was going to assault. It is quite unlikely that one would expect a person to willingly lay his life onto an altar.

22:7: **Where is the lamb?** Isaac asking about the lamb indicates that the family was quite used to the ritual of the burned offering. It was something that Abraham has already done before.

22:7: **Where is the lamb?** It is obvious that Abraham decided not to tell his son the whole story. The fact that Isaac will have to die on that mountain was completely unknown to him, just as it would have had been for a real lamb.

22:8: **God will provide**. This is a key verse, for these very words become the name of the place in v. 14. 
It is possible that Abraham was less than sincere with Isaac (for Abraham has already had a history of resorting to deception in difficult circumstances), but at the same time, those words may have been prophetic (Gen 20:7: “he is a prophet”; Jn 11:51: “He did not say this of his own accord, but ... he prophesied” -- saying that people may blurt out a prophecy without even knowing that God has put those words into their mouth).

22:9: **God had told him**. There probably was an unreported episode where God showed Abraham some specific mountain.

22:9: **Bound Isaac his son**. There probably has been some wrestling, where Abraham had overpowered his beloved Son, immobilized him, then bound him with ropes. This is why Abraham has not told him anything, and this is why he hasn’t given Isaas the knife: because Isaac wouldn’t be willing to die. He would defend his life.
Just imagine the feelings of a father: three days thinking about it on the way, then assaulting the one you love, your only son, then binding him. All that violence, and what’s ahead: murdering Isaac with his father’s hand.

22:9: (__future trust__) How amazing must have been the faith of that person who could do all that, no hesitation, having heard just one word from his God! 
After such an episode, it will be very easy for Abraham to obey God in any other matter. If you once trusted God with something dear, in a fearful labor… everything else is a breeze. You just trust. Period.

22:10: **Авраам взял Нож**, потому что был уверен, что Бог что-нибудь придумает. Стих 8: “Бог усмотрит”. (Андроник Пантак)

22:10: **Took the knife to slaughter his son**. It’s not that God was waiting until the very last moment, like in a Hollywood movie. Watching his own son cringe on an altar, Abraham had to overcome the next-to-last obstacle have the heart to obey God till the end. The reaching of the hand to take the knife indicates his final readiness. 

22:12: **Do not … now I know that you fear God.** Difficult. Sounds like God needed information? Or perhaps, another reason for the test was to show *the angels* that He has a faithful servant on earth? Far-fetched? See 1 Cor 4:9: “we have become a spectacle to the world, to angels, and to men”.
However, in the same verse, the angels says “you have not withheld your son ... **from me**”, clearly speaking for God.
So it seems. God is saying, “now I know”. Not sure what so say about it.

22:12: **You have not withheld your son, your only son, from me**. This was the fork in the road: will Abraham choose to obey God because he loved his son so much, or would he be ready to give up what he cherished? We call it parental love, caring love, but what was tested here was the selfish part of that love: the one that wouldn’t give up, even when God, just and righteous and infinitely wise, requires it.

22:12: **Now I know**.  While Abraham’s faith was earlier the means by which God counted him as righteous (15:6), that faith is now “active along with his works,” and the faith is “completed by his works” (Jas 2:21–23), so that his faith resulted in obedience, which is its expected outcome. (ESV)

22:12: (__faith vs selfishness__) The way of faith would trust God to do the right thing even when it looks ridiculous. God, You want to take what I love from me? I trust you. Please take. I believe that what You do it best.
The way of selfishness would choose your own way: I love my son, I cannot give him up. This does not make sense: murdering my son! No way, I won’t do it. It’s cruel, and it makes no sense.
Notice how natural it would be to resort to reasoning about love and logic! Faithlessness may cover itself up with common sense and lofty matters. This is why the Bibe says “lean not on your own understanding” (Prov 3:5). Because God’s ways sometimes may make no sense to us at all.

22:12: James 2:21–22 says Abraham was “justified by works” and that his “faith was completed by his works”. *Completed*, i.e., brought to its full and proper expression. This shows that “justified” in Jas 2:21 probably has the sense “shown to be righteous,” rather than the sense “counted righteous” often found in Paul’s writings. (ESV)

22:12: (**I **know**, **you fear** God; **did not withhold** from me**). It is the angel (lit. messenger) speaking (v.11: “the messenger of the Lord), and the angel said that “I” know that you fear “God”. Who knows, the angel? But further: you did not withhold your son “from me”. Could Abraham withhold his son from the angel? 
This means that the messenger is God Himself, and yet he speaks about God in third person. Then, it means that me messenger is both God and of God; which means, the messenger is Jesus Christ, the Son, speaking for God, about the Father. (Андроник Пантак)

22:13: **Instead of his son**. We can only wonder about Isaac from the point when he has seen his father change his mind about killing him. How they talked. How Abraham undid the knots. How they went back together. How they lived after such a moment.
In two chapters, Abraham will send his servant to a foreign country to find a wife for his son. There was no break in their relationship. God has somehow healed this rift.

22:14: **The Lord will provide**. “Yahweh-Yireh” (Hb) The verb literally means to see, or, to see to a thing, and the sense of the proverb plainly is that in man's necessity God will Himself see to it, and provide due help and deliverance. (Ellicott’s Commentary)

22:13-14: **Instead of his son. The Lord will provide.** There probably is a deeper, much deeper meaning to the story than just the Lord playing with Abraham’s obedience to teach him a lesson.
Remember when David sinned with Bathsheba, and his son died in 2 Sam 12? David has committed a sin, and he had to lose something dear to him. That was his lesson: the Lord’s discipline, with which He purifies us. His son had to die, because of justice.
In this story, did Abraham sin? Yes. May it be that Isaac was meant by God’s justice to be taken from him? Sure. Then Isaac has already been sealed for death in a way. It could only be averted if God Himself provided a substitution: a ram, in this case. So the ram has died for Isaac. All of this because of Abraham’s faith.
And surely Isaac and the ram is a type of mankind and Christ: mankind had to die because of sin (Isaac, sin), this punishment was only averted because of a substitutionary death of Jesus (ram), and all of this is only possible because of faith (Abraham, “the father of all who believe” (Rom 4:16)).

22:14: **The Lord will provide**. This notable episode establishes the principle of a substitutionary sacrifice: a death of a human being is required for sin (mankind), but the Lord Himself provides a substitution (Jesus).

22:14: **The Lord will provide**. God would provide the sacrifice necessary to atone for sin. **On the mount of the LORD**. The Temple mount. (ESV)

22:16: **By myself I have sworn**. Rom 6:13: “since he had no one greater by whom to swear, he swore by himself”

22:17:** As the stars of heaven ..., as the sand that is on the seashore**. The test was great, but the blessing is even greater. An overflowing one. This is how God deals with those who love Him.

22:17: **Multiply your offspring** (lit. seed, Hb. *zaraka*). Speaks about the nation, Israel. **Your offspring** (lit. seed, Hb. *zaraka*)**.** May still refer to the nation of Israel, who then **overcomes his enemies** and mediates blessings **to all the nations of the earth**, because Jesus Christ is born in them. Or may refer to a single seed, an offspring, Who is a single descendant who **overcomes His enemies** and mediates blessings **to all the nations**. Either way, it points to Christ.

22:17: Because Genesis as a whole is interested in tracing a single unique line of offspring that will eventually bring forth a special King who will rule over the Gentiles, the second half of the promise is taken to refer to a single **descendant** who will **overcome his enemies** and mediate blessing **to all the nations** of the earth. This is why Paul can insist on one offspring, who is “Christ” (Gal 3:16: “the promises were made to Abraham and to his offspring ... referring to one …, who is Christ.”).




















### Sarah's Death and Burial

23:2: **Mourn and weep**. He loved her dearly.

23:3: **To the Hittites**. Presumably Abraham addressed the leaders of the Hittites who were assembled at the gate of Hebron. The city gate was commonly the location where public decisions were formally made and transactions between individuals were ratified. (ESV)

23:6: **Prince of God**. Abraham obviously had a reputation of one living under God’s protection and favor.

23:6: **Hear us, my lord; you are a prince of God**. Hb “schemaenu adoni, attah elohim nesi”. **Prince of God**, lit. God’s king, God’s chosen one. Prince, leader, chief, captain, ruler.

23:7: **Bowed**. God’s king respectfully bowing to the people is remarkable.

23:8: **Entreat for me**. Probably means that Abraham did not know him well; otherwise, Abraham would have spoken to Ephron himself. Ephron is actually present (v.10).

23:8: **Entreat for me**. Ephron is present when these discussions take place at the city gate (v. 10), Abraham first seeks permission from the Hittite population as a whole. This may have been necessary either because Abraham himself was not a Hittite or because the transfer of property from one individual to another required the involvement of a third party. (ESV)

23:9: **For the full price**. In v.6 the implication probably was that Abraham could take anything for free. In v. 11 that’s what Ephron actually offers: take it. For free. It’s yours.

23:10: **The Gate**. Where the rulers gathered and where decisions were made.

23:12: **Bowed dows before the people**. Abraham is held in great esteem, which can be seen by his title (Elohim nesi, God’s prince), and by the fact that Ephron offers his property for free.

23:15: **Four hundred**. Since the weight of a shekel could vary, it is impossible to be certain about the precise value of the field and cave. It is often suggested, on the basis of comparisons with 1 Kings 16:24 and Jer. 32:9, that this was a high price to pay, but one cannot be sure.  (ESV)

23:17: **Land**. By acquiring this plot of land, Abraham not only establishes future rights to it for his family but puts down a marker that his descendants are to be associated with the land of Canaan, as God had already promised (ESV)

23:18: **In the presence of the Hittites, before all**. The author has dedicated the whole chapter to an episode where a certain field was legally transferred to Abraham in the presence of many people. This must have been some important patch of land for the author to pay so much attention to it. Perhaps, that is because it is the first patch of land that he legally obtains; the first step of how God’s promise begins to get fulfilled? Or was the whole episode was probably penned to emphasize the legality of Israel’s possession of that land.

23:19: According to tradition, **the cave of Machpelah** is located beneath the present Mosque of Abraham in Hebron. (ESV)

23:20: **Made over to Abraham as a property**. Abraham’s purchase of the field and cave meant that his descendants would own this land in perpetuity. Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, Rebekah, and Leah would later be laid to rest in this cave. (ESV)




















### Isaac and Rebekah

24: (__overview__) In this story, the author highlights how God controls events so that, after a long journey from Canaan to northern Mesopotamia, Abraham’s servant is guided to Rebekah. Then, like Abraham, Rebekah must leave her family and country in an act of faith in order to journey to Canaan and marry Isaac, whom she has never met. Genesis’s first audience would marvel at how God orchestrated the servant’s faithfulness, Rebekah’s positive response, and some unlikely events (e.g., v. 15) to bring about the marriage; they would be better able to see their very existence as the result of God’s guiding hand. (ESV)

24:2: Abraham entrusts the important task of finding a wife for Isaac to his most reliable **servant**. (ESV)

24:2: Likely, the **servant**’s name was Eliezer (Gen 15:2)

24:3: **Not take a wife of the Canaanites**. Jewish readers who know the history of Israel would immediately recognize that marrying a pagan woman would jeopardize Isaac’s faith. In v. 1, Abraham is already portrayed as a person who had a special relationship with God (“the LORD had blessed Abraham in all things”), and Isaac also seems to be a worshipper of God (v. 63: “to meditate”).

24:3: **Canaanites**. Abraham is deeply concerned that Isaac should not marry a Canaanite; he fears that this will draw him away from worshiping the Lord. Canaanites are frequently portrayed as being wicked in Genesis. (ESV)

24:4: The journey was approximately 900 km along ancient routes and would have taken Abraham’s servant approximately 21 days to travel. (ESV)

24:4: Later, Jacob would make this same journey as he fled from his brother Esau. He will get wives from the same region (29:1–28). (ESV)

24:4: In spite of having left Haran in northern Mesopotamia almost a hundred years earlier, Abraham refers to it as **my country**. (ESV)

24:6: **Do not take my son back there**. Isaac’s future is to be in Canaan, for God has promised this land to Abraham’s descendants. (ESV)

24:9: **Under the thigh**. By undertaking this action, the servant binds himself to obey Abraham’s request. (ESV)

24:10: **Nahor** is also the name of Terah’s father (Gen 11:25) and Abraham’s brother (Gen 11:26–27; 22:20). The use of the same name for both a city and a person is not unusual; settlements are sometimes named after people, and people are sometimes named after places. (ESV)

24:14: The servant (like Abraham) has faith in the Lord and prays for guidance. The specific request is not the ordinary way to ask for guidance: the servant might better have asked for wisdom to discern the best wife for Isaac rather than to probe into what God had providentially appointed. Nevertheless, God graciously honors the request (cf. Gideon’s fleece, Judg. 6:36–40) as his means of directing events. (ESV)

24:14: The conditions set by the servant reveal that he is seeking a wife who has a generous and caring disposition. (ESV)

24:17: Eliezer did not appear as a helpless, weary chap begging for a drink. And Rebecca, the daughter of Bethuel, the ruler of Aram Naharaim, was a young woman of nobility, not a poor servant girl accustomed to lugging water from wells. But this is precisely where Eliezer was able to get a glimpse of the righteous Rebecca. (__[Internet](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.chabad.org/theJewishWoman/article_cdo/aid/763991/jewish/Rebecca-and-the-Camel-Test.htm&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1582399365231000)__)

24:19: **I will draw water for your camels**. Camels need watered about every ten days. They can lose up to 40% of their body weight in water and fat before they feel the effects of the desert’s dry environment. A camel who has not drunk water in ten days can consume 150 liters of water in less than half an hour! 
Now let’s look at what Abraham’s servant asked as a sign for Isaac’s wife, and what the teenage girl was willing to do: she volunteered to tote more than a ton and a half of water from the spring to take care of the caravan and its camels. How many teenagers do you know that would volunteer that kind of work effort today? (__[Internet](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://rlagee.wordpress.com/2013/11/09/how-much-can-a-camel-drink-genesis-2419/&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1582399365231000)__)

24:21: He watched to see whether she just made a generous but empty offer, or she was actually going to follow through completely.

24:27: God’s swift answer to the servant’s prayer evokes an immediate response of worship and praise. (ESV)

24:29: **Rebekah’s brother Laban**. While Laban’s father Bethuel is still alive (cf. v. 50), his lack of involvement in the narrative suggests that he may well be incapacitated, possibly through old age. (ESV)

24:50: **The thing has come from the LORD**. Rebekah’s brother and father acknowledge that the providential nature of all that has taken place convincingly indicates that Rebekah should become Isaac’s wife. This is clearly God’s will. (ESV)

24:53: The gifts confirm what the servant has earlier said about Abraham’s wealth. (ESV)

24:63: **Isaac went out to meditate**. This is another divinely directed event, which allows for Isaac to be the first person to meet Rebekah when they arrive at Isaac’s homeland. (ESV)

24:65: **Covered herself**. It was customary for a woman to cover her face with a veil during the period of betrothal. (ESV)

24:67: **His mother’s death**. Sarah died when Isaac was 37 (Gen 23:1). He married Rebekah when he was 40 (Gen 25:20). (ESV)




















### Abraham's Death and His Descendants

25:1: **Took another wife**. God must have permanently enabled Abraham to have children, for even before the birth of Isaac his body had already been “as good as dead”, and he still was able to produce more children after Isaac.

25:1: **Took another wife**. Like Hagar, she has the status of a “concubine”. See 1 Chron. 1:32: “his concubine”. No indication is given as to when this relationship was established; it possibly existed before the death of Sarah. Reflecting the culture of the ancient Near East, it was not unknown for men to take “second” wives, but this was usually an action of those who were wealthy. The precise status of Keturah is unknown; she may have been a maidservant of Sarah. (ESV)

25:2: **Midian**. Moses will kill an Egyptian and come to live in the land of the **Midianites**, where he will be in exile for 40 years.

25:5-6: **Abraham gave all he had to Isaac**, but he **sent away** all his other sons, including the firstborn. 

25:8: **Abraham died** when Isaac was 75 years old. (ESV)

25:8: **Gathered to his people**. Indicates that even in the OT people’s spirits did not disappear, but were gathered together somewhere.

25:11: **God blessed Isaac**. There existed a special relationship between God and Isaac, the continuation of the relationship Abraham had.

25:11: **Beer-lahai-roi**. “The well of the living one who sees me” (Gen 16:14)




















### Esau and Jacob

25:21: Like Sarah, Rebekah is also **barren**. (ESV)

25:22: **Children struggled within her**. Introduces one of the main themes of the coming chapters: the conflict between the two brothers. (ESV)

25:22: Conflict between brothers is a recurring motif in Genesis, beginning with Cain and Abel, and is a constant reminder of the negative impact of the fall on human existence. (ESV)

25:22: **Went to inquire**. To a seer.

25:23: Normally, younger brothers were subservient to the firstborn male, who enjoyed special privileges, but God reverses human expectations. (ESV)

25:24: **Days to give birth**. The twins are born 15 years before the death of Abraham. (ESV)

25:26: The motif of deception appears in a number of episodes associated with **Jacob**. (ESV)

25:31: While **Jacob** may be criticized for exploiting his brother in a moment of weakness, **Esau** is indifferent toward his **firstborn** status. (ESV)

25:34: Because of **Esau despising** his birthright, Heb 12:16 describe him as “unholy” (“sexually immoral or unholy like Esau, who sold his birthright for a single meal”).




















### God's Promise to Isaac

26:1-2: **The former famine.** On that occasion Abraham went down to Egypt. **Isaac**, however, is stopped by God and instructed to remain in **Gerar** while he was already moving south. (ESV)

26:1: **Abimelech**. It may be the same king mentioned in chs. 20-21; it is perhaps more likely that he is the son or grandson of the Abimelech known to Abraham. However, in v.26 we see that the name of the commander of the army is still Phicol, as in 21:22; this makes it likely that it actually is the very same king. (ESV)

26:3: **the oath that I swore to Abraham**. This chapter also confirms that the divine promises to Abraham are passed on to Isaac. (ESV)

26:3: **Sojourn in this land, and I will bless you**. The Lord instructs Isaac to remain in Canaan, with the promise that he will be blessed for doing so. (ESV)

26:5: **Kept my commandments**. The words underline that Abraham’s obedience to God was unreserved. (ESV)




















### Isaac and Abimelech

26:1: **Besides the former famine that was in the days of Abraham**. These words 

26:6: Much of Isaac’s life mirrors that of Abraham. The famine, moving south, now this wife-as-a-sister episode.

26:8: **Looked out of a window**. Unlike Abraham’s story, no one has taken Rebekah as wife.

26:8: **saw Isaac laughing with Rebekah**. In this context the Hebrew verb “**to laugh**” implies **laughing** as they caress affectionately. The narrator deliberately chooses this verb to create a play on the name “Isaac,” which means “he laughs.” (ESV)

26:13: **became rich**. Because of the Lord’s blessing. (ESV)

26:15: The Philistines may have **closed up the wells** to discourage seminomadic herdsmen from grazing their livestock in this region. (ESV)

26:20: **Quarreled**. Since water was a vital commodity in this arid region, disputes over the ownership of wells were common. (ESV)

26:22: **Isaac** was **moving** away from any land that brought contention and strife, until he found a place where no one challenged him. Isaac exhibits a peaceful spirit: he is willing to give up and start anew.

26:24: **The Lord appeared**. Isaac experienced God’s presence.

26:26: **Phicol** could be the name of the very same person, or, alternatively, “Phicol” could be a family name or title and here refer to someone else. (ESV)

26:28: **Abimelech** makes the very same **covenant** with Isaac that he had made with Abraham, at the very same place (Beersheba), and for the very same reason: **the Lord has been with you**. The desire to make a peaceful covenant arises from a change of heart by Abimelech, who now acknowledges the Lord’s presence with Isaac. 
The covenant seems to become a covenant between nations.

26:29: **You are now the blessed of the Lord**. The blessed, the one on earth. Just like his father had been.

26:33: **Beersheba**. The word had already been used in v. 23, and had been used before in the Abraham’s story, which indicates that the author is well aware of anachronisms he intentionally inserts for clarity.

26:34: **Esau** chose two wives, not one. Apparently, he did not choose wisely either. Both of the are of the Hittite origin, which may indicate ungodliness. (ESV)




















### Isaac Blesses Jacob

27:4: **That I may bless you**. God had said that "the older shall serve the younger" (Gen 25:23), but Isaac's preference for another son leads him to an attempt to give a different blessing. The events show that God's declaration cannot be circumvented, and peculiar events will eventually lead to the fulfillment of the prophecy. God's word cannot be broken.

27:4: **May bless you before I die**. Such blessings were very important, for as prayers addressed to God they were viewed as shaping the future of those blessed. (ESV)

27:6: **Rebekah**. Rebekah instigates and coordinates the deception undertaken by Jacob. This mitigates, but does not remove, Jacob’s guilt in deceiving his father. (ESV)

27:8: **Obey my voice as I command you**. God clearly did not cause them to deceive Isaac, but He foresaw these events.

27:8: **Obey my voice**. Readers would see the ways in which God in his sovereignty uses all kinds of actions (good, bad, and mixed) to bring his people to the place in which they find themselves. (ESV)

27:13: **Let your curse be on me**. It's not clear whether such words can or cannot divert the responsibility for one's actions.

27:13: **Let your curse be on me**. Rebekah's actions are no doubt motivated by her special love for her son Jacob. (ESV)

27:19: **I am Esau**. This is a blunt lie told to the face of his father.

27:20: **God granted me success**. This probably falls into the category "use the Lord's name falsely". What Jacob does is simply unacceptable.

27:23: **Лия**. Иаков оказался в ситуации, когда работал семь лет чтобы жениться на любимой женщине, а в итоге оказался обманом женат на другой. При этом он в состоянии примака: когда у тебя ничего нет, и тебя кормит твой дядя. Каково это вообще мужчине жить в такой ситуации?
А всё почему? Потому что они с мамой решили помочь Богу исполнить Его обетование, которое и так было дано. А правда: вдруг Бог не справится, и обетование не исполнится; ужас-то какой, только подумайте! (МЦЦ)

27:24: **I am**. Jacob, having just received a blessing, lies again. Everything happens in the presence of the God, evidenced by frequent mentions of the Lord.

27:26: **Come near**. Isaac heard the words, and felt the hairy skin, but was not completely convinced until he smelled the clothes.

27:28: **Dew of heaven**, **fatness of the earth**, **plenty**: these blessings request an abundance of material necessities. (ESV)

27:29: **Let nations bow down**. Here Isaac asks for universal sovereignty, embracing not only immediate family but also **peoples** and **nations**. This blessing clearly builds on the divine promise to Abraham that kings will be among his descendants (Gen 17:6).

27:29: **Blessed be everyone who blesses you**. Echoes God’s promise to Abraham in Gen 12:3. (ESV)

27:36: **He cheated me two times**. From Esau’s perspective, Jacob has cheated him out of both his birthright, although Esau willingly forfeited it (see 25:33). (ESV)

27:37: **I have made him lord over you**. This blessing seems to have some real, irreversible power.

27:39-40: The words are prophetic, granted by the Spirit. There's no way that Isaac himself could have known to say that.

27:40: **You shall break his yoke**. Although Jacob has been given authority over his older twin brother, Isaac indicates that Esau will eventually free himself from his brother’s control. Later, Esau’s descendants settle outside the Promised Land, to the east of the Jordan River (see note on Gen 32:3–5), eventually taking control of Seir, which is later named “Edom” (see note on Gen 36:1–37:1). (ESV)

27:41: **I will kill my brother**. Out of hate, but also, perhaps, thinking that the blessings will be passed to him.

27:41: **I will kill my brother**. The theme of murdering a brother, which has started with Cain, continues throughout the book of Genesis and reminds the reader of sin persistent in humanity.

27:41: **The days of mourning are approaching**. Esau sees murder as something acceptable, given the situation with his brother, but the only thing that holds him down is his father.

27:42: **The words were told to Rebekah**. Once again Rebekah drives the events into the direction which God has predicted: Jacob will live to become the one God had told he would.

27:45: **Why should I be bereft of you both in one day?**. Rebekah is not just afraid for Jacob, but is afraid that both of them may die in a fight.

27:46: **Hittite women**. Isaac and Rebekah's life was bitter because of Esau's wives (Gen 26:35), and here Rebekah uses this situation to convince Isaac to send Jacob away. Like Abraham did with Isaac, they encourage Jacob to get a wife from among their relatives who are living in northwest Mesopotamia. Their advice to Jacob in turn prompts Esau to take another wife, on this occasion from Ishmael’s family. (ESV)




















### Jacob Sent to Laban

28:1: **Called Jacob and blessed him**. Interestingly, if Isaac was disappointed in Jacob after his nefarious deception, he still wants the best for him: **You must not take a wife from the Canaanite women**. Or is he afraid that Jacob would pick up their pagan religion?

28:4: **The blessing of Abraham**. Previously, Isaac only gave him a blessing concerning prosperity (*dew of heaven*) and lordship (*nations bow down*). Now, Isaac explicitly pronounces the blessing of Abraham, which concerns the many **offsptring** and the inheritance of the promised **land**. 

28:4: **The blessing of Abraham**. Esau now sees that another blessing misses him and goes to Isaac. He must have felt cheated again.




















### Esau Marries an Ishmaelite

28:6-7: There is an antithesis of the two sons. Esau **took Canaanite women**, but Jacob did not. Esau disobeyed his father in this, but **Jacob obeyed**. 

28:8: **Did not please Isaac**. Esau seeks to make amends for his earlier actions. To gain his parents’ approval, he marries one of Ishmael’s daughters. Esau, however, still retains his two Hittite wives. (ESV)

28:8: **Did not please Isaac**. The text clearly shows that his motivation for taking another wife was to please his father. Why? Did he hope to receive a blessing?




















### Jacob's Dream

28:10: **Bersheeba.. Haran**. A 900km journey. (ESV)

28:12: **A ladder.** May be a stairway or a ziggurat. What matters most is not the precise shape of this structure but its purpose; it provides a bridge between heaven and earth, revealing that God is still committed to making the earth his dwelling place. (ESV)

28:12: **A ladder.** Jesus identifies himself as the ladder linking earth and heaven (John 1:51: "you will see heaven opened, and the angels of God ascending and descending on the Son of Man") (ESV)

28:13: **The land ... I will give to you.** This is the first time that the Lord confirms that the blessing of Abraham belongs to Jacob. Isaac had wished it; the Lord has now confirmed it.

28:15: **I am with you and will keep you wherever you go**. This is a tremendous promise of God's support!

28:16: **The Lord is in this place.** Jacob thought, perhaps mistakenly, that the place has something special about it. But God did not say that He is somehow bound to this place; He said that He will be with Jacob **wherever he goes**, that is, in any place. This may be a hint towards Jacod's spiritual blindness. No surprise, given his lack of morals.

28:16: **The Lord is in this place.** Jacob’s reaction suggests that he perceived God as being with him on earth rather than in heaven. (ESV)

28:17: **Was afraid.** It seems to me that the fear Jacob experienced is not being full of awe in God's presence, but rather, a dreadful fear of an unrepentant person. But we don't know for sure. But in v. 21 Jacob promises that "The Lord will be my God", probably meaning that Jacob was godless before that.

28:17: **Was afraid.** Overwhelmed with God's power and holiness and a deep awareness of their own sinfulness and fragility, a worshipful fear emerges. (Internet)

28:18: **Set it up for a pillar.** Although Jacob commemorates this special event by setting up a pillar and consecrating it with **oil**, it is noteworthy that he does not build an altar. This is a further indication that he has not yet fully accepted the Lord as his God. Years later, however, after his faith-transforming encounter with God at Penuel (Gen. 32:22–32, Jacob Wrestles with God), Jacob returns to Bethel in order to construct an altar (35:1–7). (ESV)

28:18: **Set it up for a pillar.** While the practice of setting up pillars was common in Canaanite worship, Deut. 16:22 prohibits it (Dt 16:22: "And you shall not set up a pillar, which the LORD your God hates."). (ESV)

28:20: **A vow.** A vow that Jacob will hesitate to fulfil immediately (???check).

28:20: **If God be with me**. God has just revealed Himself to Jacob in a dream, and the dream must have been very impressive. In the dream, God has made a promise. Now Jacob holds that if the promise comes true, if God really does what He promised, Jacob is ready to be committed to Him. 

28:20: **If God be with me**. The conditional nature of Jacob’s vow reveals that he is still ambivalent regarding his commitment to the Lord. Although God reveals himself to Jacob at Bethel, it will require a further personal encounter before Jacob fully trusts in the Lord (see 32:22–32, Jacob Wrestles with God). (ESV)

28:20: **If God.** If Jacob is ready to believe God's word, it will be credited to him as righteousness. Just trusting God at His word.

28:22: **this stone … shall be God’s house**. Jacob promises that he will construct a sanctuary for God, the consecrated stone being the first part of the process. (ESV)

28:22: **Tenth**. A tithe.




















### Jacob Marries Leah and Rachel

29:1: **journey**. Just like Abraham's servant, Jacob travels to Paddan Aram to find a wife. 
While both accounts involve providential encounters at a well, subtle differences exist. Whereas Abraham’s servant prays for guidance, Jacob is not recorded as praying. 
In that episode, Rebekah waters the camels; in this episode, Jacob waters the sheep.
(ESV)

29:1: **People of the east**. This is an unusual way of referring to the inhabitants of Paddan-aram in northwest Mesopotamia. In Genesis, however, the “east” is often associated with those who are expelled or move away from God’s presence (3:23–24: "sent him out from the garden of Eden"; 4:16: "Cain settled ... east of Eden"; 21:14: Abraham sent Hagar away; 25:6: Abraham sent the sons of his concubines away). This brief comment possibly signals that Jacob’s relatives do not worship the Lord. (ESV)

29:6: **Rachel**. Providentially, Laban’s daughter, Rachel, is spotted bringing her herd to the well. (ESV)

29:6: **Rachel**. Rachel means “ewe,” an appropriate name for a shepherdess (ESV)

29:7: **go, pasture them**. Isn't it strange, Jacob giving advice to shepherds that don't even know him? 

29:10: **Jacob rolled the stone**. Jacob demonstrates extraordinary strength in being able to move the stone. (ESV)

29:10: **watered the flock of Laban**. It is Jacob's goal to find a wife from Laban's family, and there she is. So he starts helping her.

29:11: **Jacob kissed Rachel**. Probably as an act of family affection rather than of romance (cf. v. 13). (ESV)

29:11: **wept aloud**. Perhaps, he wept because he recognized God's providence in this situation?

29:13: **he ran**. Tells us about the strong feelings they had about this family reunion.

29:15: **serve me**. Jacob did not just enjoy his time with Laban, but labored with him.

29:18: **I will serve you**. In the ancient Near East it was customary for a prospective husband to give the bride’s father a substantial gift of money, known as the bride-price. Jacob indicates that he is prepared to work for Laban in order to give the equivalent of seven years’ wages for Rachel. (ESV)

29:20: **because of the love**. No doubt they spent a lot of time together.

29:21: **I may go in to her**. They had no sexual relations so far. It's been seven years already.

29:23: **Took Leah**. In Gen 31:15 we learn that none of the girls was happy with what their father has done. They called it "he has sold us".

29:23: **Took Leah**. Darkness in a world without artificial lighting can be pitch-black. At this stage, Jacob did not realize that Leah was the bride. She may also have come to him wearing a veil, the sign of a betrothed woman. (ESV)

29:25: **It was Leah**. How come Jacob didn't notice the substitution? He must have known Rachel well enough to recognize. Probably, either Jacob was drunk, or Leah didn't talk at all. Perhaps, Laban made sure that Jacob drank too much, or he instructed Leah to keep quiet. Or perhaps, Leah had herself put her eye on Jacob? It's not clear.

29:25: **Why have you deceived me?**. Jacob is reaping what he had sown: deception. It has returned to him, because God is teaching him a lesson.

29:25: **Why have you deceived me?**. The episode is full of irony. Having deceived his father by pretending to be the firstborn, Jacob himself is now deceived by his uncle Laban. He now has to labor seven more years. (ESV)

29:26: **to give the younger before the firstborn**. Laban’s remarks are highly ironic in light of Jacob’s earlier deception of his father. (ESV)

29:27: **Complete the week of this one**. The wedding celebrations lasted for seven days. Laban persuades Jacob to complete this process with Leah on the understanding that he will then be able to marry Rachel. This would also give ample opportunity for Leah to conceive a child. (ESV)

29:30: **served Laban for another seven years.** The implication is that Jacob served 14 years without earning any possessions for himself or his family.




















### Jacob's Children

29:31: **the Lord**. God hasn't been mentioned since the beginning of the chapter: the whole time Jacob worked, negotiated, married, and married again. It is possible that he lived a Godless life, and now God acts by adding misfortune to the family.

29:31: **Leah was hated**. Not surprisingly, given his unexpected marriage to Leah, Jacob’s domestic scene is fraught with tension. Laban’s deception and manipulation of Jacob creates years of discord between his two daughters. (ESV)

29:31: **Leah was hated**. Undoubtedly, he found it difficult to love Leah, given the events that had brought them together, and Rachel probably also loathed her sister for the same reason. Yet their treatment of Leah causes the Lord to favor her over Rachel. While Leah is able to have children, Rachel is barren. (ESV)

29:31: **opened her womb**. As Genesis frequently highlights, the Lord is ultimately the One who creates human life. (ESV)

29:31: **opened her womb**. Despite Jacob having slept with her already at the wedding, and despite the seven days of the wedding, Leah did not bear any children for Jacob.

29:31: **saw that Leah was hated**. Even though she was given to Jacob by deception, Jacob was supposed to treat her nicely and take care of her. **Hated** probably doesn't merely mean the lack of tender love, but some more serious negligence that led to serious sorrow. God has heard her cry.

29:31: **But Rachel was barren**. A woe to the family and grief to the loving husband.

29:32: **Because the LORD has looked upon my affliction**. Leah attributes her pregnancy to God, which means that 1) she was a God-fearing woman, and 2) she has been praying. She complained to the Lord concerning the mistreatment by her husband, his lack of love, and the suffering (**affliction**) she was in. God always hears the cry of the oppressed.

29:32: **for now my husband will love me**. A desperate hope for an unloved woman.

29:32: **for now my husband will love me**. Jacob did not choose her, he did not love her, and caused her great suffering, but he still slept with her as her husband.

29:34: **because I have borne him three sons**. While Leah, the unloved wife, was giving birth to the third son already, Rachel, the tenderly loved one, was unable to conceive. It's easy to understand how much tension this fact has added to the family.

29:34: **Левий**. Иаков по-прежнему не любит Лию. Рождение детей не исправило ситуацию. Однако как сказано? "Господь, видя, что она нелюбима". Он подарил ей детей, чтобы в них у неё было утешение. Она же воспринимает этот дар совсем иначе: она считает, что теперь её полюбит муж. (МЦЦ)

29:35: **На этот раз**. Только с четвёртым сыном она наконец поблагодарила господа Господа. До сих пор она пребывала в горечи, теперь же она начинает понимать, в чём её счастье. (МЦЦ)

30:1,2: **Envied her sister** ... **Jacob's anger was kindled**. There was plenty of bitterness in the family.

30:1: **Рахиль позавидовала своей сестре**. Обе сестры пребывают в постоянном огорчении: Лия нелюбима мужем, Рахиль не имеет детей, и ни одна из них не имеет благодарности к Богу за то что у неё есть. Рахиль недовольна и огорчена из-за радости своей сестры. (МЦЦ)

30:2: While recognizing God’s role in this situation, however, Jacob does not pray for Rachel, as his father Isaac had done for Rebekah. (ESV)

30:3: **Here is my servant**. This practice, which was also carried out by Abraham and Sarah (see 16:1–4), was part of ancient Near Eastern culture. (E.g., the Nuzi texts from the 15th century B.C. treat the concept of marriage, and many of these texts deal with the issue of childlessness and provisions for new wives.) Children born to the substitute, or second, wife were regarded as belonging to the main, or first, wife. In this way, continuity of the family line was preserved. (ESV)

30:3: **Bilhah; go in to her**. Many questions arise. What Bilnah felt about it? Was she even asked? What did Leah feel about such a decision? Was she even asked? 
Perhaps, it was normal in the ancient Near East? Then we can't read our modern-day views into it.

30:3: **Вот Валла**. Какое же это помутнение рассудка из-за зависти! Ты любишь своего мужа, ты ревнуешь его к своей сестре, и толкаешь его к вообще другой женщине. (МЦЦ)

30:6: **she called his name**. Bilnah gave birth for Rachel, so Rachel gives the name to the baby.

30:8: **Mighty wrestlings**. An apt description of the tension in the family.

30:9: **Took her servant Zilpah**. No doubt, as an act of revenge. I wonder what Jacob was thinking about this mess.

30:11: **Гад**. Значит "удача". Удача! Возможно, это упоминание языческого бога удачи (Ис 65:11-12), которого она знала из отцовского дома, где у них были языческие традиции. (МЦЦ)

30:13: **Асир**. Асир это имя ещё одного языческого божества: богини Астарта (Ашера), покровительница женщин, счастья, плодовитости. Уже второй сын получает такое имя. Едва ли Рахиль восприняла веру своего мужа. (МЦЦ)

30:14: **Mandrakes**. Because mandrakes contain deliriant hallucinogenic tropane alkaloids and the shape of their roots often resembles human figures, they have been associated with a variety of superstitious practices throughout history. They have long been used in magic rituals, today also in contemporary pagan traditions. ([Wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mandrake))

30:14: **Мандрагоры**. Мандрагоры: здесь обе девушки демонстрируют языческое мышление: попытки манипулировать реальностью с помощью волшебных средств. Похоже, это сказывается воспитание Лавана: установка, которая диктует поведение.
Лия и Рахиль едва ли восприняли веру мужа. Они всегда охотятся за удачей: мандрагоры, идолы отца, вражда друг с другом, служанки отданные мужу, имена детей связанные с удачей. (МЦЦ)

30:15: **Taken away my husband**. When such a small thing becomes an issue, this tells that there was constant hostility and old bitterness. Even a small spark brings everything up.

30:15: **Taken away my husband**. This is not true. Leah intervened into their relationship, not Rachel.

30:15: **Rachel said**. Not *Leah asked*, but *Rachel said*. Rachel knew that Leah missed Jacob. Even being his wife, she didn't get any love or affection.

30:15: **Then he may lie with you tonight**. Sounds like insanity. How in the world could **mandrakes** matter so much? And anyway, how could a woman willingly let her husband lie with another?

30:15: **In exchange for your son's mandrakes**. Probably, a rare find.

30:15: **In exchange for your son's mandrakes**.  Unfortunately, no explanation is given as to why Rachel is so eager to have these mandrakes; the context suggests that she may have viewed the plant as increasing female fertility. This and other proposals, however, must be treated with caution. (ESV)

30:15: **Пусть Иаков ляжет с тобой сегодня ночью**. Надо заметить, Иаков очень послушный муж. (МЦЦ)

30:16: **You must come in to me, for I have hired you**. It's been a long while that Jacob slept with her. Leah was still unloved, and judging by the desperate actions, she clearly suffered from it.

30:16: **for I have hired you**. Insane.

30:17: **God listened to Leah**. Leah prayed, and wanted to have more children.

30:18: **because I gave my servant to my husband**. She saw this as an act of sacrifice!

30:18: **Бог воздал**. Оказывается, Лия страдала по поводу того, что она подложила мужу свою служанку. Кстати, Рахиль не сожалеет о том , что подложила служанку. (МЦЦ)

30:20: **чтить**. В Лии что-то меняется. Она больше не мечтает уже о том ,что станет любимой, но она уже надеется хотя бы на то, что он будет её чтить. Кстати, Иакова воля была, чтобы похоронить его именно с ней. (МЦЦ)

30:20: **шестерых сыновей**. Детей служанки она даже не считает. (МЦЦ)

30:22: **God remembered Rachel**. She has been bitter so far. Even the names of her servant's sons ("judge", "wrestle") tells us about her feelings.

30:22: **God remembered Rachel**. After many years of waiting, Rachel eventually bears Jacob a son.  (ESV)

30:23: **My reproach**. Since throughout Genesis fertility is often associated with divine blessing, a woman’s inability to bear children could be interpreted as reflecting divine disapproval. Given the resentment that existed between the sisters, Leah may well have taunted Rachel over her inability to bear children. (ESV)

30:23: **мой позор**. Рувиму уже лет сорок; это же сколько лет она потратила на то, чтобы считать себя несчастной?? Просто радуйся и живи; что мешает?? Зависть. (МЦЦ)

30:24: **Joseph**. The only son from the favorite and most loved wife.

29:31-30:24: Children. 
From Leah:  **Reuben**: "see". The firstborn, the older son. **Simeon**: "hear". The second oldest son. **Levi**: "attach". **Judah**: "praise".
From Bilnah (for Rachel): **Dan**: "judge". **Naphtali**: "wrestle". 
From Zilpah (for Leah): **Gad**: "fortune". **Asher**: "happy".
From Leah: **Issachar**: "wages". **Zebulun**: "honor". **Dinah**. 
From Rachel: **Joseph**: "take away".




















### Jacob's Prosperity
30:25: **As soon as Rachel had borne Joseph**. That would be 14 years into their marriage, because this is how much Jacob had agreed to serve. Interesting coincidence? well... unless Jacob is trying to leave sooner than it was agreed.

30:27: **learned by divination**. Laban had *household gods* (Gen 31:19), so this divination was a pagan practice. He probably perceived that "The Lord" was one of the many deities. 

30:27: **learned by divination**. The Israelites were later prohibited by God from practicing divination (Dt 18:10) because it sought to provide knowledge by inappropriate methods (e.g., interpreting omens, using supernatural powers). Laban’s use of divination is sinful, even though the information obtained is accurate. (ESV)

30:27: **The Lord has blessed me because of you**. That's one example of God's blessing spreading to neighbors. It's likely that Laban was not blessed for the way he treated Jacob, for he actually deceived him, and will deceive him more. The blessing must have been given to Laban so that Jacob could receive his riches through him.

30:27: **The Lord has blessed me because of you**. In Genesis, all the members of the special line descended from Abraham are portrayed as mediating God’s blessing to others. (ESV)

30:28: **Name your wages, and I will give it**. Laban's initial readiness is actually completely hypocritical. Laban is actually reluctant to lose Jacob’s service, which has brought him considerable wealth. Read on.

30:28: **Name your wages**. Later we learn that Laban was a very stingy person who cheated Jacob and mistreated his own daughters not only when giving them away in marriage, but also afterwards (Gen 31:15: "he has sold us and he has indeed devoured our money").

30:28: **Name your wages**. For 14 years Jacob has served Laban in order to pay the bride-price for Leah and Rachel. Having fulfilled this obligation, which has financially benefited Laban well beyond what he might have expected, Jacob now wants to provide for his own household. Laban, conscious of how Jacob has enriched him and eager to retain his services, asks Jacob to name his wages for remaining with him. (ESV)

30:30: **For my own household**. Jacob had agreed *to serve*, which means that every labor of his, and all the fruit, were Laban's. It **has increased abundantly**, and even though it did not belong to Jacob, he worked faithfully to multiply the possessions of another, without envying, or asking anything for himself. Must have been a great lesson for him.

30:32: **speckled and spotted sheep**. Jacob was probably convinced that Laban was stingy and would not want to share. His actions in v. 35 confirm that. So Jacob's request seems very modest at first: a few speckled animals. That's something that Laban would easily agree to.

30:32: **speckled and spotted sheep**. How in the world did he devise this highly unusual plan?

30:33: **my honesty** ... **shall be counted stolen**. Such measures are never devised without a good reason. After 14 years, Jacob knows Laban very well, and he likely anticipated that Laban would try to argue for a lesser share.

30:37: **Jacob took**. Where does this odd breeding program come from? In Gen 31:10, Jacob confesses that it was a dream in which God has revealed a plan to him. Jacob was given advance knowledge of which animals would be born due to which animals were breeding. 

30:37: **Jacob took**. In many miracles in the Bible, God required people to go through some token action. Moses was instructed to hold his staff over the Red Sea before God parted the waters. Naaman had to dip himself seven times in the Jordan River before God would cure his leprosy. Joshua and the Israeli army had to walk in circles around Jericho and blow on trumpets before God destroyed the walls of the city. But it is not the action itself that produced results; it was God. 
The principle is that God does not allow people to just sit back and sip on champagne while God performs miracles to pull their feet out of the fire. When there is something people can do to help themselves, he expects them to do it. And when there is nothing that people can do to help themselves, he still requires them to perform some token, symbolic action. 
I presume that Jacob's putting the striped sticks in the water was in the same category. It did not cause the animals to be born spotted. It was just a token action that God required of Jacob before God would perform a miracle for him.
(Internet)

30:39: **Brought forth striped, speckled, and spotted**. Scientifically speaking, those white animals may have had recessive genes of color.

30:41: **The stronger of the flock were breeding**. This is an example of the principle of genetical inheritance in the Bible. Strong genes + strong genes = strong animal. That's the basics of animal breeding.

30:43: **The man increased greatly**. After working for 14 years for his two wives, Jacob would now work 6 years for himself (Gen 31:41: "twenty years"). From Jacob's speech in Gen 31:36-42 we learn that he's worked faithfully, suffered loss, suffered injustice from the hands of Laban, had his wages cut, and still worked faithfully. A blameless person he's been made into.

30:43: **Female servants and male servants**. It's unclear where those servants came from. When Jacob arrived to Paddan-Aram, he only had his staff with him (Gen 32:10: "with only my staff I crossed this Jordan"; staff = walking stick). Was he given more servants? Were they born to Bilnah and Zilpah?




















### Jacob Flees from Laban
31:1-2: **Jacob has taken all**, **Laban did not regard him with favor**. Jacob’s growing wealth becomes a source of friction within Laban’s family. Even Laban’s own attitude toward Jacob changes. (ESV)

31:1: **The sons**. Laban had other children, and they started to slander Jacob that **he has taken** something from their father; consequently, from them. What was it? The spotted cattle? But Jacob foresaw that when he made the agreement. Probably, he knew the family too well after all these years.

32:2: **Laban did not regard him with favor**. As soon as Jacob ceased working to multiply Laban's possessions, his attitude changed. Laban understood that he had been only *blessed because of Jacob* (Gen 31:27), but still this understanding didn't stop the heart from evil. He was envious.

31:3: **The Lord said**. It's unclear whether Jacob communed with God during all those years, because it's not mentioned. God, however, blessed Laban because of him.

31:3: **I will be with you**. This is a great promise of divine blessing and protection. 
Jacob could have had his doubts because of a) Laban, b) the multitude of cattle, c) his wives and children, d) the long journey, e) he's lived here for 20 years (Gen 31:41: "twenty years")! But after hearing  Jacob could just pack up and leave on a long journey home. No more doubts.

31:5: **God has been with me**. In saying this, Jacob acknowledges that the events of his life depended on God all these years. Probably, he's learned a number of lessons, including humility -- when seeing that Laban's household is blessed, and then he saw how God has suddenly made him prosperous.

31:6: **I have served your father with all my strength**. That's one of the lessons he's learned. 20 years ago (Gen 31:41: "twenty years") he used to take advantage of people; now he learned to serve faithfully. Must've been a hard lesson; how did he learn it?

31:7: **Your father has cheated me**. Jacob got back what he sowed: he can now experience cheating first hand, and probably learn another lesson: how it feels like when you're cheated.

31:8: **If he said**. Jacob explains that if it is God's plan for him to prosper, then whatever a person says or does, the plan will still be fulfilled regardless.

31:9: **Given them to me**. How does it feel like to have almost nothing, working for a wealthy person for 14 years, see how his (not yours) possessions multiply, and still work faithfully for him to manage *his* economy... and then, after all these years, to discover that God actually meant to give it all to you from the very beginning? Wow.

31:12: **For I have seen all that Laban is doing to you**. God, speaking through the angel, says the words He usually addresses to a person afflicted by others. God comes to right the wrong: to take the possessions from Laban and give it to Jacob.
It seems that Laban still has a lot: all the white cattle is his, at least; and those spotted ones he has hidden.

31:13: **God of Bethel**. At Bethel, God had promised to be with Jacob (Gen 28:15: "Behold, I am with you and will keep you wherever you go, and will bring you back to this land."). Some 20 years later, Jacob acknowledges God’s faithfulness (v. 5: "God has been with me"). (ESV)

31:13: **You made a vow to me**. A reminder to fulfill his vows? A note that that time is right?

31:14: **Rachel an Leah**. For once, they've agreed on something.

31:14: **Is there any inheritance left in our father's house?**. They both are fed up with their stingy father as well.

31:15: **Regarded as foreigners**. His own daughters.

31:15: **Sold us, devoured our money**. Only now we see what Leah and Rachel thought about that strange wedding. They didn't like the actions of their father at all.

31:16: **Whatever God has said to you, do**. When making tough decisions, it's very important to have support from your loved ones.

31:18: **To his father Isaac.** Jacob wouldn't know whether his father was still alive or not.

31:19: **Laban had gone to shear his sheep**. Fearful that Laban will prevent him from leaving Paddan-aram, Jacob escapes when his father-in-law is away shearing sheep. (ESV)

31:19: **His sheep**. This verse tells us that God has not taken *everything* from Laban, but only a portion. It's clear that Laban's bad attitude was based on envy, not on need.

31:19: **Rachel stole her father's household gods.** Why? 
a) She took them as an act of vengeance because she knew they mattered to Laban; b) because they were valuable, and she was frustrated over Laban robbing her of inheritance (v. 15);
c) perhaps she believed that this would prevent him from using their power to overcome Jacob (divination); 
d) possibly she thought that they would bring her good fortune; but unlikely, because she worshipped the Lord.

31:19: **Household gods.** This tells us about Laban's religion. He was a pagan. 

31:19: **Household gods** (Hb. *terapim*) is mentioned frequently in the Bible, but knowledge of these objects is vague. Since in v. 30 Laban refers to them as "gods", they may have been small figurines depicting particular gods. (ESV) 

31:20: **Not telling him that he intended to flee**. Such an act would definitely insult and outrage Laban. That's why it says in Hebrew, literally, "stole the heart of Laban".

31:20: **Not telling him that he intended to flee**. Why didn't he tell Laban? Because after years of experiencing this person, Jacob knew he couldn't expect anything good from him. 
See v. 31: "Because I was afraid that you would take your daughters from me". 

31:19-20: **Rachel stole... Jacob stole**. Rachel stole Laban's gods, and Jacob stole his heart.

31:21: **Gilead**. That's several hundred kilometers south from Paddan-Aram.

31:22: **on the third day**. Jacob had chosen the time wisely: Laban has been *very* busy with his cattle. 

31:23: **For seven days**. Laban had to travel 43% faster than Jacob to catch up with him in seven days! 
> (3+7) * V₁ = 7 * V₂ ; V₂ = (10/7) * V₁ ; V₂ = 1.43 * V₁

31:23: **For seven days**. The journey was at least 480 kilometers long. So Jacob done around 50 kilometers a day. Laban had to do around 70 kilometers a day to catch up. 
It's likely that Jacob simply walked for 10 hours a day with his normal speed. He had cattle; remember! Laban probably had either to ride, or to walk at least 14 hours a day!

31:23: **Gilead**. That's almost home. 50 kilometers to Bethel; 100 kilometers to where his father lives.

31:24: **God came to Laban**. To Laban the pagan. Laban may have not been a godly person, but he revered God's power at least.

31:24: **Not to say anything**. A request that makes sense... until you here: **either bad** ... **or good**. Why would God not allow Laban to say good things? Perhaps, because until now every good thing he had said has proven to be dishonest hypocrisy? And God knew that Laban was unable to say a single good thing to Jacob from a sincere heart?

31:27: **with mirth and songs**. This is probably hypocrisy: on the outside, he would have made a nice party for his son-in-law; but on the inside, he would rather do him harm (v. 29).

31:27: **with mirth and songs**. Laban seeks to portray Jacob in a poor light by contrasting his secretive flight with Laban’s desire to have a joyful send-off. (ESV)

31:29: **It is in my power to do you harm. But...**. Had it not been for God's interference, Laban would have harmed Jacob. All that talk about mirth & songs is probably hypocritical: after years of life with Laban, Jacob has experienced mistreatment from him.

31:29: **God of your father**. Although Laban acknowledges that God has spoken to him, he refuses to acknowledge God as his own; he is the God of Isaac. To underline this point, Laban asks Jacob, *Why did you steal my gods*? (v. 30) (ESV)

31:31: **Because I was afraid that you would take your daughters from me**. This is the truth why Jacob has set out without telling Laban.

31:32: **Shall not live**. Hasty words. But Jacob was certain that there were not thieves in his camp.

31:32: **Point out**. In response to the accusation, Jacob invites Laban to search through the whole camp. And so he does: goes through every thing.

31:35: **He searched and did not find**. Rachel sitting on and concealing Laban’s “gods” emphasizes the total impotence of such idols. (ESV)

31:35: **He searched and did not find**. Metaphorically speaking, Laban searched for a god, but found none.

31:39: **I bore the loss**. All this demonstrates how faithful a servant Jacob has become.

31:43: **All what you see is mine**. Here Laban finally shows his true attitude to things: he believed that everything belongs to him. That's a really high degree of greed.

31:44: **Let's make a covenant**. Apparently, a gesture possibly intended to save face. (ESV)

31:45-46: **A stone ... a heap**. The two witnesses likely reflect the deities worshiped by Jacob and Laban. Jacob’s single stone stands in marked contrast to the heap of stones set up by Laban and his relatives. 
Ancient Near Eastern treaties normally involved the gods as witnesses, the treaty between Jacob and Laban also required divine witnesses. Because Jacob is not prepared to compromise his monotheistic faith, two witnesses are established.
(ESV)

31:50: **God is witness**. Laban wanted to, but could not, take anything from Jacob. He's been stopped by God Himself. Now Laban can only make an agreement, asking the very same God to be the witness.




















### Jacob Fears Esau

32:1-2: **the angels of God met him**. More probably, as Jacob on his road to Padan Aram had been assured of God's watchful care of him by the vision of the angels ascending and descending the stairs, so now also in a dream he sees the angels encamped on each side of him, to assure him of protection against his brother. (Ellicott's Commentary)

32:1: **Ангелы Божии**. Господь, желая ободрить праведника и рассеять всю его боязнь, даровал ему узреть полк ангелов. (Иоанн Златоуст)

32:1-2: **the angels of God met him**. Messengers of Elohim.

32:1-2: **God's camp**. A vision of the very angels that have kept Jacob safe thus far.

32:1: **Ангелы Божии**. Этим они давали понять Иакову, что если бы Лаван не послушал Бога, явившегося ему вечером, то на следующее утро и он, и все бывшие с ним были бы умерщвлены рукой Ангелов, хранящих Иакова. (Прп. Ефрем Сирин)

32:2: **Camp**. Since camps were mobile, unlike houses, Jacob’s remark suggests that God has sent his angels to accompany Jacob safely back to the land of Canaan. (ESV)

32:2: **Нарёк имя месту тому**. Чтобы это наименование служило постоянным напоминанием о бывшем ему там видении. (Иоанн Златоуст)

32:4-5: **my lord... your servant... favor in your sight**. The tone of Jacob’s message to Esau is very deferential. (ESV)

32:6: **Four hundred**. That's a lot. Genesis 14 recounts how Abraham, with a force of 318 men, successfully went to battle against four kings. (ESV)

32:7: **Afraid and distressed**. Jacob had heard God say, "I will be with you" (Gen 31:3), and apparently was afraid that God's protection only covered the travel; not the meeting with the brother. 
He didn't lose faith; otherwise, he would've turned around. No righteous one risks death of his whole family unless he's certain that won't happen.

32:7: **Two camps**. Perhaps, he drew the inspiration for such a wise action from the vision he'd seen of two camps? (v. 2)

32:7: **Afraid and distressed. He divided.** Jacob’s actions, while understandable from a human perspective, reflect his inability to trust God fully for protection. (ESV)

32:9: **Said**. Prayed. In his distress, Jacob does several things. 
First, he refused to turn around, or settle in another land, even though he had sufficient resources to do so. He's had God's commandment.
Secondly, he does what he humanly could to improve the situation: *he divided the people*. 
Thirdly, he prayed for God's help.

32:9: **LORD**. This is the first time Jacob addresses God using his special name, “Yahweh,” translated here “LORD”. (ESV)

32:9: **Return to your country**. Shows that Jacob is still following God's guidance. He's just afraid. Being human.

32:10: **I am not worthy**. God's made him into a meek person with a worshipful spirit.

32:10: **steadfast love and all the faithfulness that you have shown**. God used all these years of hardship to bring Jacob into a relationship with Himself. Jacob knows God now. Jacob knows His qualities.

32:11: **Please deliver me**. Jacob prays, knowing, that despite any action of his, the ultimate deliverance comes from God.

32:12: **But You said**. Jacob trusts God and His promises. This may be counted to him as righteousness.

32:13: **He stayed there that night**. Imagine how does it feel like to go to sleep, knowing that an army is marching to kill you and your family.

32:13: **He took a present**. Jacob demonstrates a curious mix of prayer, where he asks God for help, and action, where he does what's possible. He didn't count on God doing everything for him; he's learned that God helps those who act, and who act righteously.

32:18: **your servant Jacob … my lord Esau**. Jacob’s deferential attitude is noteworthy, given earlier statements about the older serving the younger (see 25:23) and Isaac’s blessing, which speaks of Jacob’s being lord over his brothers (27:29). (ESV)




















### Jacob Wrestles with God

32:22-32: Jacob Encounters God at Peniel. This passage records a nighttime encounter between God and Jacob. Jacob is transformed by this extraordinary meeting, which is marked by the changing of his name from “Jacob” to “Israel.”. (ESV)

32:22: **Wives, servants, children**. Jacob took his nearest and dearest people with him. 
He also took "everything he had" (v. 23), but the author emphasizes his family members.

32:23: **He sent them across the stream**. This looks like flight. Clearly Jacob did not anticipate meeting God that night! He was just trying to resolve the crisis. By sending his dearest people away from the coming fight.

32:24: **Was left alone**. His intention was probably to meet Esau alone, without jeopardizing anyone else. He was ready to die, but wanted to ensure no harm comes to his family.

32:24: **A man wrestled**. The unexpected and sudden introduction of this man, who wrestles in the dark with Jacob, captures something of the event itself. 
By the time their contest comes to an end, Jacob is convinced that his opponent is God himself (see v. 30). (ESV)

32:22-14: **Jabbok... Jacob... Wrestled**. The story contains an interesting wordplay in Hebrew: God wrestles (ye’abeq) with Jacob (ya‘aqob) by the Jabbok (yabboq). (ESV)

32:24: **Боролся Некто с ним**. Велико человеколюбие Господне! Всё это делалось по снисхождению, чтобы изгнать из души праведника страх и побудить его идти навстречу брату без всякого опасения. (Свт. Иоанн Златоуст)

32:24: **Боролся Некто с ним**. невероятным кажется то, что он, будучи один, ночью, неизвестного принял мышцами, а не мечом или луком; поелику он не был уже в возрасте крепости телесной, имел около ста лет от рождения. (Свт. Филарет Дроздов)

32:24: **Боролся Некто с ним**. Борьба Божия, по-видимому, долженствовала происходить в духе, но борьба Иакова кажется действием телесным. (Свт. Филарет Дроздов)

32:24: **Боролся Некто с ним**. Почему боролся Иаков с Богом? Бог ведь за секунду мог уничтожить его? Почему допустил Господь борьбу с Иаковом? Господь желал благословить Иакова. (Прп. Гавриил (Ургебадзе))

32:25: **повредил состав бедра**. Зачем?
1) чтоб Иаков признал борьбу не за мечтание и призрак, но за истинное явление и действие; 
2) чтоб узнал в своем противоборце Всемощного; 
3) чтобы непобедимость приписал не своей силе, но вышней помощи; 
4) чтобы в хромании оставить памятник сей благосердой брани. 
(Свт. Филарет (Дроздов))

32:26: **I will not let you go unless you bless me**. Somehow, by the end of the struggle, Jacob came to realize that he is wrestling with a heavenly being. Perhaps, he even understood that it was God himself.
How did he understand that? Well, he has recently prayed, fervently. His heart and his mind were open to heavenly things. He was ready to see and accept.

32:26: **I will not let you go unless you bless me**. It is interesting that upon realizing Who he's wrestling with, Jacob did not cease to wrestle in reverence. He kept holding the man.

32:26: **Пусти Меня, ибо взошла заря**.  Слова сии допускают различные изложения:
«Оставь меня: я хочу быть ощутим, но невидим»;
«Оставь меня, ибо заря призывает тебя к твоему ополчению и к продолжению путешествия»;
«Оставь меня, дабы с наступлением дня не обнаружить недостойным или слабым видения, для них не вместительного».
(Свт. Филарет (Дроздов))

32:28: **Your name shall no longer be called Jacob, but Israel**. Through all this, Jacob has finally come to realize the importance of being blessed by God. The events of the preceding years have changed Jacob. The God of his father has now become his God. 

32:28: **no longer Jacob, but Israel**. He is not a deceiver anymore. He's changed. By God's grace, and work.

32:28: **Ибо ты боролся с Богом, и человеков одолевать будешь**. Ободрение для Иакова в преддверии встречи с братом. 

32:29: **на что ты спрашиваешь о имени Моем?**. Держись, говорит, в назначенных тебе пределах и не преступай меры. Ты хочешь получить от Меня благословение? Вот Я даю тебе благословение. (Свт. Иоанн Златоуст)

32:29: **Скажи имя Твое**. Конечно, Иаков доселе думал, что Божество явилось ему в лице Ангела; и вопросил о имени его или для того, чтобы после употреблять сие имя в призывании Бога, или для того, чтобы ответствовать на благословение, или для того, чтоб имя явившегося дать месту явления. (Свт. Филарет (Дроздов))

32:29: **На что ты спрашиваешь о имени Моем?** Ты не можешь благословить Меня новым именем, как Я тебя. (Свт. Филарет (Дроздов))




















### Jacob Meets Esau

33:1: **So he divided the children**. He had sent them away across the stream (Gen 32:23), but clearly, after his encounter with God, he changed his decision.

33:1: **Разделил**. Не три группы образовал Иаков, как считают очень многие, а две. **Разделил** Акила перевёл как "поделил пополам", то есть Лия и Рахиль были в одной группе. (Блж. Иероним Стридонский)

33:2: **The servants with their children in the front**. Even though all the children were Jacob's, the servants' children had less favor in his eyes.

33:2: **The servants with their children in the front**. Dan, Naphtali, Gad, Asher.

33:2: **then Leah with her children**. Reuben the firstborn, Simeon the second oldest son, Levi, Judah, Issachar, Zebulun, Dinah.

33:2: **Rachel and Joseph last of all**. The beloved wife, and the child he loved most tenderly.

33:2: **Joseph** is the only one of Jacob’s sons to be named here. Jacob’s special treatment of Joseph becomes an important theme later in Genesis. (ESV)

33:2: **Рахиль**. Паче всех Рахиль соблюдается от опасности, не только как возлюбленная, но и как первая, по намерению Иакова, супруга. (Свт. Филарет (Дроздов))

33:3: **Came near to his brother**. Esau did not attack immediately.

33:3: **Bowing ... seven times**. Jacob’s actions are clearly intended to express his submission to Esau. Jacob’s behavior is noteworthy, especially given the earlier divine revelation that the older would serve the younger. (ESV)

33:3: **Поклонился до земли семь раз** Иаков выражает этим отсутствие в нем горделивых замыслов — господствовать над старшим братом и как бы раскаяние Иакова в несправедливости, допущенной им относительно Исава при получении благословения. (Лопухин А.П.)

33:4: **Esau ran to meet him**. The unreserved manner in which Esau greets and embraces Jacob reveals that he holds no animosity toward his brother. (ESV)

33:4: **Esau ran to meet him**. The description of their reconciliation may well have influenced Jesus’ account of the lost son returning to his father. (ESV)

33:4: **Embraced him**. God orchestrated the events in such a way that there was no real danger, but by all appearances, there were serious fears that have driven Jacob to God in distress. And there, in that encounter, the change of Jacob's heart has been made final.

33:4: **Embraced him**. Twenty years of separation have brought about forgiveness. Esau missed his brother, of whom he heard nothing in all these years. He also heard how their mother and father missed Jacob. All of this has softened his heart.

33:4: **И плакали**. Иаков страшится, как опаснейшего врага, своего брата, но своею осторожностью, молитвою, пожертвованиями, смирением и прозорливым от общения его уклонением без брани остается его победителем.  (Свт. Филарет (Дроздов))

33:10: **Like seeing the face of God**. Esau does not know that, but Jacob has really seen the face of God the night before. Still under the impression, Jacob sees something similar in those two encounters.

33:10: **Like seeing the face of God**. Jacob draws a remarkable parallel between his earlier encounter with God and his meeting with Esau. Like God, Esau shows unmerited favor to Jacob. (ESV)

33:11: **Please accept my blessing**. Previously, Jacob had deprived Esau of the blessing of the firstborn. While Jacob cannot restore this particular blessing to Esau, he seeks to make restitution by giving him another blessing, which comes from God’s blessing of Jacob. (ESV)

33:11: **God has dealt graciously with me**. Jacob recognizes that all that he has, both children and possessions, are from the Lord.

33:12: **Иаков же сказал ему**. На самом же деле Иаков, видимо, опасается, как бы мир с братом не был нарушен при дальнейшем совместном путешествии. (Лопухин А.П.)

33:14: **I will lead on slowly**. Jacob politely refuses and invents all sorts of excuses because his intention was not to follow Esau south. He had to go to Bethel first and fulfill his vows.
Why then did he send messengers (Gen 32:3) to inform Esau of his coming, if he wasn't going to come immediately? Either he had to ask His brother before entering the land; or more likely, Jacob had a change of mind after the encounter with God, and so he had a change of plans.

33:15: **Оставлю я с тобою несколько из людей**. Ради охраны, или для выражения почёта, в качестве свиты. (Лопухин А.П.)

33:16: **Seir**. Jacob will never actually reach Seir. Or at least, Moses never written anything about it. Jacob would only meet Esau when Isaac dies (Gen 35:29)

33:17: **Succoth**. Jacob did not tell his brother that he did not intend to go to Seir directly. Instead of following his brother south, Jacob started west, crossed the Jordan river, and **built himself a house**. He obviously was not planning to go home just yet. [Map](https://i0.wp.com/headwatersresources.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/patriar.png)

33:17: **Succoth** was only 7 kilometers to the west.

33:17: **Сокхоф**. Иаков предположительно пребывал здесь два года. (Лопухин А.П.)

33:18: **Благополучно пришёл в Сихем**. Выражение «благополучно» или «цел — невредим» еврейские и некоторые христианские толкователя понимали, как указание на исцеление бедра Иакова от раны после таинственной борьбы. (Лопухин А.П.)

33:18: **Сихем**. У евреев есть предание, что в этом месте бедро хромающего Иакова окрепло и стало здоровым. Поэтому и город получил название в честь исцелённого и ставшего совершенным бедра. (Блж. Иероним Стридонский) 

33:18: **Shechem**. Jacob goes further west. It's about 32km west of Succoth.

33:18: **Shechem** was the first place named in connection with Abraham’s arrival in Canaan. God had appeared to Abraham here and promised Him many descendants (Gen 12:67). And here one descendant, Jacob, is going to *purchase a piece of land* (v. 19) and *build an altar* to the Lord. (ESV)

33:19: **He bought the piece of land**. Jacob has started to acquire property in Canaan, the promised land.

33:19: **Купил**.  Если Авраам приобрел в Хевроне место погребения жене и себе, то Иаков в Сихеме приобретает поле для обитания на нем, чем и выражает веру в божественное обетование о наследовании Ханаана его потомством. После на этом месте погребены были кости Иосифа (Нав. 24:32); в евангельское время (Ин. 4:5–6) и даже теперь упоминается о колодезе Иакова близ Сихема. (Лопухин А.П.)

33:20: **Altar**. Previously, Abraham had built an altar at Shechem. Possibly, Jacob reconstructs this earlier altar, for the Hebrew verb used to describe his action is not the usual one for building altars. (ESV)

33:20: **Altar**. Since this is the first altar mentioned in connection with Jacob, it signals his commitment to worship the Lord. This is reinforced by the name he gives the altar. (ESV)

33:20: **El-Elohe-Israel**. God, the God of Israel. Such a tender name would mean that Jacob came to a closer relationship with God. 

33:20: **Поставил там жертвенник**. Подобно Аврааму, поставившему по прибытии в Ханаан жертвенник в Сихеме (Быт. 12:7), ставит здесь жертвенник и Иаков, призывая теперь Бога, как уже Бога Израиля, т. е. своего, а не только Бога отцов. (Лопухин А.П.)




















### The Defiling of Dinah

34:1: **Дина**. Прошло не менее чем 8 лет после прошлой главы: Дина, родившаяся в конце второго семилетия службы Иакова у Лавана (30:21), уже взрослая девушка лет 16. Ей было 6–7 лет при прибытии Иакова в Сокхоф, около 2 лет Иаков жил там и, следовательно, жил около 8 лет в Сихеме). Симеон и Левий тоже стали взрослыми юношами. (Лопухин А.П.) 

34:3: **Spoke tenderly to her**. It is striking that after such an event she stayed with him, and they even talked.

34:3: **Говорил по сердцу девицы**. Должно думать, что утешал обещанием правильного супружества. (Свт. Филарет (Дроздов))

34:6: **Went out to Jacob**. Some days have already passed.

34:5: **Jacob heard** and did nothing. Because *his numbers are few*, and it was not in his power to respond with force (v. 30). 
Dinah have not returned was still at Shechem's house (v. 26). But probably, he couldn't do much, because it was *the prince of the land*: a powerful person in a foreign land.

34:7: **In Israel**. The first time Israel is mentioned as a people.

34:9: **Make marriages with us**. That's something that God will explicitly prohibit: marriages with pagan people. Jacob already knew that, for he's seen how bitter the life of Isaac has become because of the pagan wives of Esau. He himself went to Paddan-Aram to find himself a wife.

34:10: **Dwell with us**. That's the king of the land speaking. Such words sound like an official invitation, and refusing an invitation like that might mean a diplomatic conflict.

34:11: **Let me find favor in your eyes**. Shechem the prince is trying to make amends for what he has done.

34:13: **The sons of Jacob answered**. Although Hamor comes to speak to Jacob (v. 6), the latter appears to be pushed aside by his sons. They are the ones who engage in discussion with Hamor and Shechem. (ESV)

34:13: **Deceitfully**. The Hebrew term used here (*mirmah*) implies treachery. Although Jacob’s sons resemble their father, whose name means “he deceives” (see 25:26), their actions here are about to go beyond anything he has done. (ESV)

34:13: **Deceitfully .. because he had defiled**. No doubt, they thought they had the right to act treacherously because of the prior injustice dealt to their family by Shechem. That's a very human approach: to find excuses for sinful behaviors, appealing to circumstances and the deeds of other people. Calling that "justice".

34:14: **Who is uncircumcised**. While Jacob’s sons are right to insist that circumcision is necessary in order for both groups to become one people, their intention is not to bring those people to God, but to murder them. (ESV)

34:15: **Be circumcised**. They are using the sign of God's covenant as the means for achieving revenge. Isn't that double nasty?

34:15: **Be circumcised**. The brothers realized that they cannot defeat a king in his full power. 

34:15: **Circumcision**, which was intended by God to bring divine blessing, leads on this occasion to death and destruction. All of this takes place without any reference to God. (ESV)

34:15: **Обрезание**. Само предложение обрезания не могло ни удивить, ни раздражить евеян: обрезание, по свидетельству Геродота, существовало издревле у египтян, финикиян и др., след., могло быть известно и у хананеян, которые в Библии обычно не называются необрезанными. Скорее удивительно, что евеяне оставались необрезанными, когда, напр., сильное племя Измаила, несомненно, имело обрезание. О внутреннем значении и смысле обрезания сыновья Иакова ничего не говорят Сихему и Еммору. (Лопухин А.П.)

34:16: **Become one people**. This deception has gone really far.

34:19: **He was the most honored of all his father's house**. A man capable of rape is **most honored**? Tells us a lot about those people's morals and values. They probably respected people acting "manly".

34:20: **Spoke to the men**. Probably, not trying to convince them, but using their power and reputation to have them do what Shechem wanted.

34:21: **Their daughters**. It is clear that Israel did not have many daughters at the moment.

34:23: **Their livestock, their property, will be ours**. This is something that's more likely to motivate the folks. Greed.

34:24: **Every male was circumcised**. They were ready to go through a painful operation in order to have women and cattle.

34:25: **На третий день**. Абен–Езра замечает, что болезнь обрезания обыкновенно сильнейшим образом чувствуется на третий день. (Свт. Филарет (Дроздов))

34:25: **На третий день**.Третий день после совершения обрезания характеризуется наибольшим воспалением раны после операции.  (Лопухин А.П.)

34:25: **Simeon and Levi**. Sons of Leah.

34:25: **Simeon and Levi**. The significance of this episode is that **Simeon and Levi** are the 2nd-born and the 3rd-born sons of Jacob, and they will bring a curse on themselves because of this massacre, effectively losing some of their inheritance rights: "Cursed be their anger, for it is fierce, and their wrath, for it is cruel! I will divide them in Jacob and scatter them in Israel." (Gen 49:7).
*Reuben* the firstborn will also lose his inheritance rights (Gen 35:22: "lay with his father's concubine"), and because of these events, Judah inherits the blessing, and kings come from his line.

34:25: **Simeon and Levi**. Although all sons were involved in the deception of Hamor and Shechem, only Simeon and Levi are involved in the slaughter. (ESV)

34:25: **Took their swords**. They were acting without the consent of their father, the head of the family.

34:25: **Killed all the males**. A clear overreaction: for the transgression of one person, should the whole city be put to the sword? It's incredible how much hatred they had.

34:25: **Killed all the males**. While the rape of Dinah by Shechem is inexcusable, the punishment meted out by Simeon and Levi far exceeds the crime. (ESV)

34:25: **Killed all the males**. This act of theirs has influenced the prophecy Jacob will say on them: "Cursed be their anger, for it is fierce, and their wrath, for it is cruel! I will divide them in Jacob and scatter them in Israel." (Gen 49:7)

34:26: **Убили мечом**. В книге Иудифь (Иудифь 9:2-3) избиение сихемлян и разграбление их города представляется делом суда Божья над первыми за насилие Дине: "Го­с­по­ди Боже отца моего Симеона, которому Ты дал в руку меч на отмще­ние иноплемен­ным ... Ты сказал: да не будет сего, а они сделали. И за то Ты пред­ал князей их на убие­ние... по­раз­ил рабов подле владетелей и владетелей на тронах их, и отдал жен их в расхище­ние, дочерей их в плен и всю добычу в раз­дел сынам, воз­люблен­ным Тобою, которые воз­ревновали Твоею ревностью". Это толкование в корне противоречит словам Иакова же в Быт 49:7: "проклят гнев их, ибо жесток, и ярость их, ибо свирепа".

34:27: **The sons of Jacob** may refer to more than the original pair of Simeon and Levi whose initiative that was.

34:27: **Plundered the city**. Now their behavior is not much different from the greedy people of Shechem who wanted to possess Israel's livestock.

34:29: **Their wives**. As servants, or as wives?

34:30: **Said to Simeon and Levi**. While all the brothers are involved in the deception and the plundering of the city, Jacob later attaches particular guilt to Simeon and Levi for the massacre of the men of Shechem. (ESV)

34:30: **You have brought trouble on me**. Jacob’s condemnation focuses not on the morality of their actions, but on the possible consequences. (ESV)

34:30: **You have brought trouble on me**. Jacob did not agree with the course of action his children have taken.

34:30: **Trouble**. Almost as soon as Jacob returns to Canaan, an incident threatens the future security of his whole family. (ESV)

34:30: **My numbers are few**. Jacob had a lot of livestock, but unlike Abraham, he did not have an army.

34:30: **У меня людей мало**. Как бы так говорил: разве не знаете, что нас немного и мы сами легко можем потерпеть тоже самое, что решились вы сделать им. И как Сихем стал причиною такой гибели для отца и для всех жителей города, так и вы – для меня.  (Свт. Иоанн Златоуст)

34:30: **Истреблён буду я и дом мой**. На эту сторону дела пока и обращает их внимание Иаков, высказывая порицание их поступку; полную же оценку его с нравственной стороны он дал на смертном одре (Быт. 49:5–6). (Лопухин А.П.)

34:31: **Should he treat our sister like a prostitute?**. While they are reluctant to acknowledge any fault on their part, Jacob is very conscious of how their actions have endangered his entire household. (ESV)




















### God Blesses and Renames Jacob

35:1: **Arise**. Jacob has already lived in Shechem for over a year (perhaps 1 1/2, or even as long as 8), and obviously hesitated to fulfil his vow at Bethel. Now God tells him to arise and leave, having said these words as a kind reminder. And Jacob does not linger anymore: immediately he speaks to his family.

35:1: **Go up to Bethel**. This has broken Jacob's plan to follow Esau, if there was one.

35:1: **встань, пойди в Вефиль**. Бог даёт ему повеление идти в Вефиль, которое одновременно было и одобрением и напоминанием. (Лопухин А.П.)

35:1: **Altar**. Jacob had only set up a pillar at Bethel (Gen 28:18). By returning to Bethel and building an altar there, Jacob acknowledges that God has been faithful to him. (ESV)

35:1: **Поставь там жертвенник Богу**. В первый раз, если исключить жертвоприношение Исаака, Бог является в Св. истории требующим жертвенника. Не потому ли требует, что Иаков, обещав десятину, ожидал какого‑либо внушения или наставления о том, как исполнить сей обет? (Свт. Филарет (Дроздов))

35:1: **To the God who appeared to you**. God, who has fulfilled his promises to Jacob, reminds Jacob of the promise he has given to God. 

35:2: **И сказал Иаков дому своему**. Заметь и послушание и благочестие праведника. Лишь только услышал он: «взыди в Вефиль, сотвори жертвенник», – тотчас, созвал всех своих домашних. (Свт. Иоанн Златоуст)

35:2: **Put away the foreign gods**. So Jacob, himself being a God-fearer and a leader of the family, knew that there were pagan gods amidst them, and tolerated that. Did he also know about the gods Rachel has stolen from Laban?

35:2: **Foreign gods**. That go against the first prohibition of the Ten Commandments (Ex 20:3). (ESV)

35:2: **Put away ... purify yourselves and change your garments**. Rachel’s theft of her father’s household **gods** suggests that polytheistic beliefs existed within Jacob’s household. These must be eradicated. 
The members of Jacob’s household must **purify** themselves. While no details are given here, later Israelite tradition emphasized the importance of purification rituals, some of which involved the washing of clothes. This may explain Jacob’s final instruction to change **garments**. (ESV)

35:2: **«Поверзите боги чуждыя**, которых взяли вы в разграбленном вами Сихеме. (Прп. Ефрем Сирин)

35:2: **Богов чужих**. Пример Иакова может служить к очищению понятия прославляемой в новейшие времена терпимости вер. Правда, что любовь долготерпит, не раздражается (1 Кор. 13:4). Но она не исключает и снедающей ревности по доме Божием (Ин. 2:17). (Свт. Филарет (Дроздов))

35:2: **И очиститесь**. Еврейское слово טהר означает очищение, в особенности верою (Чис. 31:23-24: "и все, что проходит через огонь, проведите через огонь, чтоб оно очистилось, а кроме того и очистительною водою должно очистить; все же, что не проходит через огонь, проведите через воду"). (Свт. Филарет (Дроздов))

35:2: **И очиститесь**. Догадка (Grot, in Mat, с. Ill), что употребление в богослужении омовения особенно установлено в память потопа как очистительного действия всемирного, имеет в себе нечто сообразное с духом священной древности. (Свт. Филарет (Дроздов))

35:3: **In the day of my distress**. Jacob primarily means the recent events (Esau, Shechem), but also all other events since his first vision at Bethel.

35:3: **Has been with me wherever I have gone**. God didn't just ask Jacob to worship Him; God has actually proven Himself to Jacob. And so it seems, God hasn't required anything from Jacob but a righteous heart.
Interesting how God works, isn't it? God, the Maker of the universe, *proving Himself* to people. And asks worship only *after* Jacob's heart trusts Him. Which He Himself has won.
That's how love works.

35:4: **Rings .. in their ears**. Probably the rings were somehow related to their pagan religion?

35:4: **Rings .. in their ears**. It is not clear whether these earrings were worn by the people or by the foreign gods; some ancient Near Eastern evidence indicates that idols could have earrings (ESV)

35:4: **Серьги**. Здесь должно разуметь не простое украшение, употребляемое женским полом, но такое, которое служило некоторым родом талисмана, и которое Блаженный Августин называет *idolorum philasteria*, хранилищами идолов. (Свт. Филарет (Дроздов))

35:4: **They**. It's interesting how Jacob's decision to follow God also spreads to everyone with him. This surely includes his wives, and clearly now includes his servants. Which were not too many, but still.

35:4: **So they gave**. It's interesting, how easy people have given up their beliefs. Is it because they have also witnessed how good has God been to Jacob, and participated in the blessing? After all, they're all part of the same household.

35:4: **Hid them under the tree**. Likely not with the purpose of getting them back again. They have thrown them away completely.

35:4: **Закопал их Иаков под дубом**. Иаков закапывает эти предметы в землю (по иуд. преданию — тайно, чтобы никто не извлек их обратно). (Лопухин А.П.)

35:4: **Под теревинфом** (вместо под дубом). Терпентинное дерево по долговечности способно для приметы мест. Место сие после уважаемо было Израильтянами (Нав. 24:26: "И вписал Иисус слова сии в книгу закона Божия, и взял большой камень и положил его там под дубом, который подле святилища Господня.", Суд. 9:6: "И собрались все жители Сихемские и весь дом Милло, и пошли и поставили царем Авимелеха у дуба, что близ Сихема."). (Свт. Филарет (Дроздов))

35:4: **под дубом, который близ Сихема**. Судя по всему, дуб пользовался известностью  (Быт. 12:6; Нав. 24:26; Суд. 9:6). (Лопухин А.П.)

35:5: **И отправились они**. \[Бог не только нагнал страху на окрестных жителей, но и Иакову дал смелость идти через их края.\] Как праведнику Он дал смелость, так на тех навел страх. (Свт. Иоанн Златоуст)

35:5: **Did not pursue the sons of Jacob**. For the massacre they have committed at Shechem (Gen 34:25).

35:5: **A terror from God**. God directly influences the senses of humans to make Jacob seem more dangerous to them than he really was.

35:5: **A terror from God**. It is interesting how God protects the family from the consequences of their actions at this particular instance, despite His disapproval. God did not let the massacre go unnoticed though, for Jacob would pronounce a prophetic curse on those who committed them. (Gen 49:7)

35:5: **A terror from God**. How did this **terror** look like? Those people have heard that Jacob's sons have massacred the entire city of Shechem, and there was a desire to **pursue** them and take revenge. The desire was likely discussed at their cities' gates, but invariably, even in distant towns, people have overestimated Jacob's power (Gen 34:30: "my numbers are few"). Perhaps, even to the point of being fearful of the same massacre happening to their own cities!
That's how **a terror from God** would look like. Irrational fear.

35:5: **A terror**. May also mean the fear of God himself. The fear of God used to protect the patriarchs before (Pharaoh; Gen 20:8 Abimelech; Gen 26:28: Laban).

35:5: **И был ужас Божий на окрестных городах, и не преследовали сынов Иаковлевых**. Так, когда Бог благоволит оказать Свою помощь, то и слабых делает крепче сильных, и малочисленных сильнее многочисленных, и нет блаженнее человека, приобревшего помощь свыше. Нет сильнее человека, стяжавшего вышнюю помощь, как нет слабее человека, лишенного этой помощи. (Свт. Иоанн Златоуст)

35:5: **Ужас Божий**. Ревность Иакова по чистоте веры и послушание ему его семьи вознаграждается ниспосланною Богом безопасностью ее со стороны соседних племен, между тем как после сихемского кровопролития Иаков ожидал нападения. (Лопухин А.П.)

35:6: **Came to .. Bethel**. It was a relatively short journey of about 30km, but no doubt, a very stressful one. God probably didn't tell Jacob that his family was under protection, and Jacob had every reason to think that they were not anymore.

35:7: **Built an altar**. Some 20 years after this promise has been made. This doesn't mean Jacob lingered; this means that God's guidance can be a long process sometimes, but that's a sure process.

35:7: **Эл–Вефиль**. Значит Бог Вефиля. Так назвал себя прежде сам Бог, явясь Иакову (Быт. 31:13). (Свт. Филарет (Дроздов))

35:8 **Deborah, Rebekah’s nurse**. Rebekah's nurse. That's Jacob's mother's nurse. What is she doing here?

35:8: **Умерла Девора**. Из дома ли Исаака пришла она к Иакову или последовала за ним из дома Лавана — разыскание тщетное. (Свт. Филарет (Дроздов))

35:8 **Deborah, Rebekah’s nurse** previously received just a brief mention in Gen 24:59 ("So they sent away Rebekah their sister and eher nurse, and Abraham's servant and his men."), although this is the first time that her name is given. 
Her presence with Jacob may suggest that she had been sent to him by Rebekah in fulfillment of her promise in Gen 27:45 ("until your brother's anger turns away from you, and he forgets what you have done to him. Then I will send and bring you from there.") (ESV)

35:8: **Девора**. Традиция иудейская говорит, что Ревекка, согласно данному ей обещанию Иакову (27:45) по истечении 14 лет пребывания Иакова в Харране послала туда Девору с известием, что Иаков может теперь возвратиться. (Лопухин А.П.)

35:9: **God appeared again**. Unlike the previous episode, no details are given. It cannot be the same episode, because of **again**.

35:10: **God said**. Transformed by the experiences of Bethel and Peniel, Jacob is now in a position to assume the mantle of his father as the one through whom the divine promises to Abraham will be continued. (ESV)

35:10: **No longer shall your name be Jacob**. God’s statement here confirms the importance of the transformation that has taken place in Jacob’s life. (ESV)

35:10: **Israel shall be your name**. This time, the change of name is also linked with the building of an altar, the fulfillment of a vow.
In Bethel, Jacob's path with God has started, when he set a stone. God has been with Jacob everywhere he went. Now, after living 20 years with God and going through miscellaneous tests with Him, Jacob is a different person. And at the very same place where this journey has started, this new Jacob receives a new name. Israel. No more a deceiver.

35:10: **Имя твое**. Бог повторяет переименование Иакова, может быть, потому, что сей, по смирению, доселе не употреблял и не открывал нового своего имени. (Свт. Филарет (Дроздов))

35:10: **И Бог назвал его именем Израиль**. Несколько раньше Ангел вовсе не даёт имени Иакову, но предсказывает, что имя должно быть дано Богом. Поэтому то, что там было обещано как будущее, здесь утверждается как исполнившееся. (Блж. Иероним Стридонский)

35:11: **I am God Almighty** (El Shaddai). This is how God revealed himself to Abraham (Gen 17:1–2), and is the divine name used by Isaac when he blesses Jacob in 28:3. (ESV)

35:11: **be fruitful and multiply**. This instruction goes back to the very creation of humanity (Gen 1:28). (ESV)

35:11: **Nations shall come from you**. It the first time that God gives Jacob the very same promise he gave to Abraham: that his descendants will be numerous. This happens only after (on the surface) Jacob has fulfilled his vow and (actually) when Jacob's path was over and he was a new, godly, person, devout to God in word and deed.

35:11: **Nations**. Not just Israel, but many nations.

35:11: **Kings shall come from your own body**. This is a new promise that hasn't been given to Abraham. 

35:12: **Abraham**. The link that shows that it is the very same promise. Jacob now continues the line.

35:12: **Isaac**. Now God confirms that even though Jacob was not the firstborn, he is the son of the blessing.
Notice how God's plan, predicted before Jacob's birth, was implemented by the means of Jacob's deception. The responsibility for this deception is fully on Jacob, but God's plan comes true anyway.

35:13: **Went up**. This means that previously God has *come down*. 

35:14: **set up a pillar, poured oil**. Jacob performs the very same actions that he had performed 20 years earlier at that same place (Gen 28:18-19: "So early in the morning Jacob took the stone that he had put under his head and set it up for a pillar and poured oil on the top of it. 19 He called the name of that place Bethel, but the name of the city was Luz at the first.")

35:14: **Drink offering**. Later references suggest that wine was used (e.g., Ex. 29:40; Lev. 23:13; Num. 15:1–10). (ESV)

35:14: **И возлил на него возлияние**. Во времена закона для сего употреблялось вино (Чис. 15:5), знамение радости духовной. (Свт. Филарет (Дроздов))




















### The Deaths of Rachel and Isaac

35:16: **From Bethel**. The plan is not to return to Shechem. Jacob travels south from Bethel, undoubtedly with the intention of going to Mamre (Hebron). (ESV)

35:16: **Ephrath**. Means "fruitful". Later called Bethlehem (v. 19). Very close to Jerusalem.

35:17: **В родах**. по Мидрашу, с каждым сыном Иакова рождалась вместе и сестра, а с Вениамином — 2 сестры. (Лопухин А.П.)

35:17: **Не бойся**. Повивальная бабка пытается утешить ее, напоминая страстное желание ее иметь второго сына, и возвещая ей, что рождается у нее именно сын. (Быт 30:24: "И нарекла ему имя: Иосиф, сказав: Господь даст мне и другого сына"). (Лопухин А.П.)

35:18: **His father called him**. This is the first son whose name is given by Jacob. All other sons are named by his wives.

35:18: **Ben-oni**. The name is ambiguous and may mean "son of my strength", as well as "son of my sorrow". Jacob deliberately changes the name and removes the ambiguity, for "the right hand" also means "strength". (ESV)

35:18: **Rachel** gave the son a bitter name, but Jacob did not want his son to bear such a name. Why?

35:18: **Benjamin**. The only other son born from Rachel is Joseph.

35:18: **her soul was departing**. This is one place in the OT where the word “soul” (Hb. nepesh) denotes what gives life to the body. (ESV)

35:18: **Вениамин**. Рахиль хотела ещё одного сына, из зависти и ревности. Она всё ещё несчастна. И называет сына "сын горести". Но тут уже Иаков не выдерживает и вмешивается, чтобы парень не жил всю жизнь с таким именем. 
Рахиль умерла несчастной, потому что сама испортила себе весь свой путь. (МЦЦ)

35:19: **Rachel died**. She was his most loved wife. Perhaps, even the only wife he really loved.

35:20: **Set up a pillar**, but did not give it a name.

35:20: **Rachel's tomb**. Jewish tradition locates the tomb between Bethlehem and Jerusalem. This tradition, however, can be traced back only to the fourth century A.D. (ESV)

35:20: **Rachel's tomb**. Because Rachel was buried at Bethlehem, Matthew uses her as an archetype of Jewish women weeping at Bethlehem for their massacred children in Mt 2:18 ("A voice was heard in Ramah, weeping and loud lamentation, Rachel weeping for her children; she refused to be comforted, because they care no more.”).

35:20: **Надгробный памятник**. В 1 Цар. 10:2 гробница Рахили указывается на границе Вениаминовой, т. е. значительно севернее, равно и в Иер. 31:15 (о плаче Рахили над пленными евреями, слышном в Раме) предполагается близость этой гробницы к Раме в колене Вениаминовом. (Лопухин А.П.)

35:22: **Reuben**. The firstborn son.

35:22: **Reuben lay with his father's concubine**. While Reuben’s action may have been prompted by inappropriate lust, it challenged Jacob’s position as head of the household. As the firstborn son, Reuben may also have viewed his action as establishing his authority over his brothers. See 2 Sam. 16:20–23, where David's son deliberately goes in to his father's concubines. (ESV)

35:22: **Israel heard of it**. This verse implies that he's done nothing this time. This event is, however, remembered as a curse in the end of Jacob's life (Gen 49:4: "Unstable as water, you shall not have preeminence, because you went up to your father's bed; then you defiled it—he went up to my couch!"). On the basis of this episode, Reuben will actually lose his firstborn rights.
The 2nd and the 3rd sons, Simeon and Levi, have already lost their blessing because of the massacre. 
The next in line is Judah, and it is from his line that kings will come, as God has promised (Gen 35:11: "kings shall come from your own body").

35:23: **Reuben (Jacob's firstborn)**. This verse helps us understand what has just happened. The **firstborn** son has defiled his father's bed.

35:23: **Двенадцать** колен Израилевых.

35:26: **Родившиеся в Месопотамии**. Говоря точнее, писатель должен был исключить из сего Вениамина, который родился в земле Ханаанской. Но он допустил небрежность такую, которая никого не могла ввести в заблуждение. (Свт. Филарет (Дроздов))

35:27: **His father Isaac**. When Jacob met Esau a couple of years ago, he learned that his father was still alive. Jacob couldn't have know it before that moment: so for over 20 years he didn't know how his father was.

35:27: **Came to his father**. After almost 30 years! What a meeting it must have been!

35:27: **Came to his father Isaac**. While Gen 27:1-2, where Isaac's eyes were dim when he gave Jacob the blessing, may suggest that his death was imminent, Isaac has remained alive during Jacob’s 20 years of exile in Paddan-aram. (ESV)

35:28: **Isaac .. 180 years**. While Jacob lingered in Shechem, he really risked not to see his father alive.

25:28: **Gathered to his people**. Indicates that even in the OT people’s spirits did not disappear, but were gathered together.
This is supported by the words of Jesus in Mt 22:32: "And as for the resurrection of the dead, have you not read what was said to you by God: ‘I am the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob’? He is not God of the dead, but of the living.”

35:29: **Esau and Jacob**. Last time they've seen each other was at Peniel, where Esau came with 400 men to meet his brother Jacob, and then went back to Seir alone, while Jacob has had a change of plans.

35:29: **Buried**.Isaac was buried in the cave at Machpelah (Gen 49:30-31: "in the cave that is in the field at Machpelah, to the east of Mamre, in the land of Canaan, which Abraham bought with the field from Ephron the Hittite to possess as a burying place. There they buried Abraham and Sarah his wife. There they buried Isaac and Rebekah his wife, and there I buried Leah”"). (ESV)

25:29: **Breathed his last**. The report of Isaac’s death, like that of Abraham in 25:7–10, marks the end of an era and brings to a natural conclusion the main narrative section that began with 25:19. (ESV)




















### Esau's Descendants

36:2: **Esau took .. wives**. The wives of Esau are given here as: Adah (of Elon the Hittite), Oholibamath (of Anah, of Zibeon the Hivite), Basemath (of Ishmael, sister of Nebaioth). 
But in Gen 26:34 the following women are named: Judith (of Beeri the Hittite), Basemath (of Elon the Hittite). In Gen 28:9 he also takes: Mahalath (of Ishmael, of Abraham, the sister of Nebaioth).
So: there are two sisters of Nebaioth: Mahalath and Basemath, born of the same Ishmael. And there are two sisters born of Elon the Hittite: another Basemath,, and Adah.
Esau took sisters as wives!
However... those previous wives aren't mentioned in the list of generations to come. Didn't they bear any children?

36:2: **Basemath**. (1) Esau may have married more than three women; (2) the same woman may have been known by two different names. (ESV)

36:2: **Жёны**. Признавая, что эти вариации могли быть обязаны древневосточному обычаю переименования или даже ошибке переписки, отметим моменты сходства во всех трех редакциях: а) Исав имел три жены; б) одна из них называлась Васемафа; в) две были хананеянки; третья — дочь Измаила. (Лопухин А.П.)

36:4: **Елифаз**. Это тот Елифаз, о котором упоминает Писание в Книге Иова. (Блж. Иероним Стридонский) Но он скорее всего не прав, потому что в ст. 11 сказано что "Елифаз родил Фемана", а не наоборот; в то время как в книге Иова Елифаз назван "Феманянином" (Иов 4:1). Это подтверждает Лопухин А.П. (ст. 11)

36:4: **Eliphaz**. The Midrash relates that when Jacob escaped from Esau and fled to his uncle Laban in Haran, Esau sent Eliphaz to pursue and kill Jacob, his uncle, who was his Rabbi also. When they met, Jacob implored Eliphaz not to kill him, but Eliphaz challenged that he had his father's instructions to fulfill. Jacob gave everything he had with him to Eliphaz and said, ”Take what I have, for a poor man is counted as dead." Eliphaz was satisfied and left his uncle and rabbi poor, but still alive: (Rashi to Book of Genesis Gen 29:11) (Wikipedia)

36:6: **Away from his brother Jacob**. Esau has moved away from the land he's lived in for decades. Does this indicate that their relationships were bitter still? Or does he move away from **Canaan**, the promised land, because it was promised to *another*? Was it envy, rivalry, or respect?
**Edom** would become an enemy nation of Israel. Obadiah claims that the Edomites participated in the destruction of the First Temple by Nebuchadnezzar in 587 BC. 
vv. 2 and 8 remind us that Esau is Edom, so the author likely expected the reader to think of hostility.

36:6: **В другую землю**. Исав уже избрал Сеир главным местом своего пребывания, но пребывание он мог почитать случайным только и временным дотоле, доколе жив был Исаак. По смерти отца, вместе с окончательным разделом наследия долженствовал между братьями последовать и решительный разбор мест обитания. Должно думать, что завещание Исаака утвердило Иакова на земле Ханаанской, Исав же только не противоборствовал сему. (Свт. Филарет (Дроздов))

36:6: **От лица Иакова**. Мидраш не без основания говорит, что это удаление Исава «от лица Иакова» означало, что Исав не будет иметь участия в обетованиях Авраама. (Лопухин А.П.)

36:7: **Their possessions were too great**. The motive for their separation is the same as the motive for the separation of Lot and Abraham had been.

36:8: **И поселился Исав на горе Сеир**. Сие соединено было с изгнанием прежних жителей (Втор. 2:12: "В Сеире жили прежде Хорреи, но сынове Исавовы овладели ими"). Исав уже начинает жить мечом своим (Быт. 27:40: "ты будешь жить мечом твоим"). (Свт. Филарет (Дроздов))

36:8: **Сеир**. Во Втор. 2:4-5 говорится, что Сеир Исаву отдал во владение Сам Всевышний и что израильтяне не должны иметь каких-либо претензий на эту страну. (Втор. 2:4-5: "гору Сеир Я дал во владение Исаву") (Лопухин А.П.)

36:9: **Seir**. By a clever use of genealogical information, vv. 9-43 reveal that Esau’s descendants established themselves as the dominant group in Seir. (ESV)

36:11: **Eliphaz .. Teman**. Eliphaz, the first of the three visitors of Job (Job 2:11), was supposed to have come from Teman (Job 4:1: "Eliphaz the Temanite"), an important city of Edom. Thus Eliphaz appears as the representative of the wisdom of the Edomites, which, according to Obadiah 8, Jeremiah 49:7, and Baruch 3:22, was famous in antiquity. ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eliphaz_(Job)))

36:11: **Елифаз .. Феман**. **Феман**, 1-й сын **Елифаза**, дал имя городу, не раз упоминаемому у пророков (Иер. 49:20: "опустошат жилища их"; Ам. 1:12: "пошлю огонь на Феман"; Ав. 1:9: "Поражены будут страхом храбрецы твои, Феман, дабы все на горе Исава истреблены были убийством"; Иез. 25:13: "так говорит Господь Бог: простру руку Мою на Едома и истреблю у него людей и скот, и сделаю его пустынею; от Фемана до Дедана все падут от меча"); жители его, по-видимому, известны были своей мудростью (Иер. 49:7: "разве нет более мудрости в Фемане?"); одним из потомков Фемана, сына Елифазова, был старший из друзей Иова — феманитянин (Иов. 2:11: "Елифаз Феманитянин"). (Лопухин А.П.)

36:12: **Амалик**. Амаликитяне были при Моисее сильнейшим племенем Аравии (Исх. 17:8: "И пришли Амаликитяне и воевали с Израильтянами в Рефидиме"). (Лопухин А.П.)

36:15: **Chiefs**. Since chiefs were normally tribal leaders, these verses indicate that Esau became the father of 14 tribes. (ESV)

36:16: **Amalek**. Likely the father of the Amalekites. **Amalek** is a nation described in the Hebrew Bible as an enemy of the Israelites. 

36:20: **Сыновья Сеира Хорреянина**. Часть 2. Родословие Сеира, жившего в земле Идумейской прежде Исава, присовокупленное для показания различия и взаимных отношений родов. (Свт. Филарет (Дроздов))

36:22: **Финна**. Может быть, та самая, которая была наложницею Элифаза и родила Амалика (ст. 12) (Свт. Филарет (Дроздов)). 

36:22: **Финна**. Это та самая Фамна, о которой было сказано выше. И эта Фамна была наложницей Елифаза, первенца Исава. И от неё родился Амалик (ст. 12) (Блж. Иероним Стридонский). 

36:30: **царствовавшие в земле Едома**. Список царей производит впечатление глубокой древности. Царская власть у Едома в то отдаленное время, видимо, не была наследственной: ни один из 8 царей не принимает царской власти по преемству от отца своего. Народное избрание, или даже узурпация, определяли преемственное следование их одного за другим, причем были цари и чужеземные, как Саул из города Реховоф на Евфрате (ст. 37). (Лопухин А.П.)

36:31: **Kings**. Although the kings listed here succeed one another, the list probably records a series of dynasties, each associated with a particular city. (ESV) 

36:31: **Before any king reigned over the Israelites**. The author of v. 31 either lived after the Israelite monarchy was a reality or clearly anticipated that one would be established. (ESV)

36:38: **Baal-hanan**. This is a clear sign that paganism has replaced godliness in his line.

36:39: **Хадар**. Достойно примечания, что о царе, последнем в списке, сообщено несколько более подробностей, нежели о предшествовавших, а о смерти его не сказано, хотя то сказано о всех прочих. Сие подает мысль: не он ли царствовал в то время, когда Моисей посылал послов из Кадеса к царю Эдомскому? (Чис. 20:14). (Свт. Филарет (Дроздов))




















### Joseph's Dreams

37:xx: This story serves the first readers by explaining how they came to be in Egypt, namely, through God’s mysterious use of evil and noble deeds to bring about his purpose (cf. Gen. 50:20). (ESV)

37:2: **Братья**. Десять детей Иакова росли и видели, что отец не любил их мать. Как думаете, что они будут испытывать по отношению к двум любимчикам? (МЦЦ)

37:2: **Братья**. В отличие от Авраама и Иакова, в случае двенадцати сыновей, Божье благословение передаётся не одному человеку; благословение распространяется на всех их, которые должны стать одним целым: Израилем. (МЦЦ)

37:2: **Joseph** and Benjamin are the only sons of Rachel, the wife that Jacob loved the most. They were Jacob's favorites, as can be clearly seen from the story, and other brothers resented Joseph because he, as it seems, enjoyed favoritism way too much. This time, he **brought a bad report**: basically, told on his brothers.

37:2: **A bad report**. The report was probably true: we'll see in v.11 that Jacob trusted Joseph (about his dreams not being made up), and that the brothers were able to do wicked things.

37:2: **Иосиф был семнадцати лет**. Иоанн Златоуст считает, что Иосиф был добр к своим братьям: "Для чего он означает нам и число лет? Дабы научить тебя, что юность нисколько не может быть препятствием к добродетели – чтобы вполне показать тебе и повиновение юноши отцу, и расположение к братьям, и их жестокость в том, как, не смотря все его расположение к ним и самый возраст его, способный возбуждать сочувствие к себе, они не сохранили братской любви, но с самого начала, замечая в нем наклонность к добродетели и любовь к нему отца, начали ему завидовать." (Свт. Иоанн Златоуст)

37:2: **Семнадцати лет .. будучи отроком**. В том, что об Иосифе, после указания 17-л. его возраста, говорится, что он был молод (naar, отрок), еврейские толкователи видели указание на детски-наивное (отчасти — в неодобрительном смысле) поведение Иосифа, благодаря которому он невольно навлек на себя ненависть своих братьев. (Лопухин А.П.)

37:2: **Пас скот**. Младший из всех других Иосиф (он был семнадцати лет) от труда пастушеского не уклонялся, но вместе с другими братьями прилагал старание к тем же занятиям, не праздность, столь приятную для юношеского возраста и всегда как бы любезную предпочитая, не избегая преждевременной заботы житейской и не любя более всего распущенность (Свт. Кирилл Александрийский)

37:3: **Loved Joseph more**. In two verses we see a lot of favoritism: **the robe**, the **love**, and the **bad report**. That's some unhealthy family relations.

37:3: **Loved more**. Remember how much bitterness has this favoritism brought between Rachel and Leah? The same bitterness is not growing among the brothers, where one enjoys much more affection than all the others. Jealousy has already come as a result. 

37:3: **Loved Joseph more**. And bestowed on him privileges normally given to the firstborn. Joseph’s royal dreams further antagonize his older brothers, who cannot accept that he will reign over them. (ESV)

37:3: **Любил Иосифа более**. Приятно любить детей и весьма приятно любить их сильнее. Однако неумеренная отеческая любовь часто вредит детям. Например, чрезмерная снисходительность расслабляет возлюбленного сына или предпочтение одного из них отвращает от братского чувства всех остальных. Больше же приобретает тот сын, который приобретает любовь братьев. (Свт. Амвросий Медиоланский)

37:3: **Потому что он был сын старости его**. \[Про Вениамина, самого младшего, и сына любимой жены, такого не сказано. Поэтому причиной любви был не порядок рождения.\]
Смысл такой: Иаков любил Иосифа преимущественно пред другими детьми за его добрые душевные свойства; но не открывал этой причины, а давал вид, что любит Иосифа более других детей потому, что Иосиф сын его старости. А написал это законодатель, как я думаю, повествуя не о том, что было, но указывая лишь предлог и отговорку отца. Это был вымысел отца, желавшего прекратить братскую войну.
(Свт. Иоанн Златоуст)

37:3: **Разноцветную одежду**. Преимущественную любовь свою к Иосифу Иаков выразил тем, что сшил ему как бы первенцу (ср.Быт. 27:15 — о богатой одежде Исава) особую одежду. (Лопухин А.П.)

37:4: **Возненавидели**. Они могли опасаться (по замечанию Абарбанеля), как бы отец не лишил их всякого наследства из-за Иосифа. (Лопухин А.П.)

37:4: **Увидели .. что отец любит его более .. и возненавидели**. До какой степени они начинают ненавидеть его, ничем их не оскорбившего. (Свт. Иоанн Златоуст)

37:4: **Не могли говорить с ним мирно**. Поелику слово **мир** употребляется у евреев во всех обыкновенных приветствиях, то слова сии могут иметь такой разум, что братья Иосифа не хотели даже приветствовать его при свиданиях. (Свт. Филарет (Дроздов))

37:4: **Не могли говорить с ним мирно**. **Не могли** сказано потому, что обладаемые страстью в самом деле чувствуют себя как бы не в силах делать то, чего долго и упорно не хотели. (Свт. Филарет (Дроздов))

37:4: **Brothers .. hated him**. Ever since Cain, the theme of hatred among brothers is a common reminder of the original sin living in man's heart. 

37:5: **Dream**. Although it is not specified here, in Genesis dreams are normally associated with divine revelations. (ESV)

37:5: **Told it to his brothers**. No doubt, he told it with pleasure. Didn't he know that such a dream won't be pleasing to his brothers, who already hated him? 

37:8: **Hated him for his dreams**. The probably thought that Joseph has made it up to irritate them.

37:9: **Told it to his brothers**. Now it's clear that he is doing this on purpose: telling those things being well aware that brothers won't like it at all. He's just teasing them, and then telling on them. What a son.

37:9: **To me**. This time, Joseph already gives an interpretation of the dream. Before, he simply described it. This probably means that the first dream has added up to his pride, and Joseph started to think even more highly of himself.

37:9: **Солнце и луна и одиннадцать звёзд**. Солнце, луна и одиннадцать звезд поклонились Иисусу Христу, когда после Воскресения святая Мария - луна, благословенный Иосиф - солнце, и одиннадцать звезд, то есть благословенных апостолов, преклонились пред Ним и исполнилось пророчество: Хвалите Его, солнце и луна, хвалите Его, все звезды и свет (Пс. 148:3).  (Свт. Кесарий Арелатский)

37:9: **Солнце и луна и одиннадцать звезд поклонились мне**. Поклонение солнца и звезд трудно представить. Может быть, сие было нисхождение их с высоты к ногам Иосифа. (Свт. Филарет (Дроздов))

37:10: **To this father**. This time he wanted to tease his brothers in the presents of the father. There is no doubt that the dream was real, but it's also inconceivable that Joseph was speaking out of naivete. He's already seen that his brothers didn't like the story.

37:10: **Shall I and your mother**. When Joseph had this dream, his mother Rachel was probably dead; “your mother” refers to Leah. (ESV)

37:10: **Я и твоя Мать**. Поелику Рахили в сие время уже не было в живых, то сие слово некоторые относят к Лии, яко старшей супруге Иакова, а некоторые к Балле, почитая ее питательницею Иосифа. Но можно также относить оные и к Рахили; и тогда речь Иакова будет изображать невозможность того, чтобы сон Иосифов исполнился. «Неужели я и умершая уже мать твоя тебе поклонимся?». 
Сомнительно здесь токмо то, какую из его матерей значит Луна? Ибо и Лия скончалась в земле Ханаанской (Быт. 49:31), а о других супругах Иакова сказание о переселении не упоминает (Быт. 46:26). Но если Лия скончалась незадолго до переселения, то она, вместе с Иаковом, поклонилась уже Иосифу через сынов своих, когда они просили у него хлеба (Быт. 42:7).
(Свт. Филарет (Дроздов))

37:11: **Kept the saying in mind**. Jacob rebuked Joseph for his arrogance, but at the same time he had no doubt about Joseph's truthfulness.

37:11: **Отец заметил это слово**. Отец понял, что это было откровение Божие, обратил внимание на сказанное. Но не так поступили братья. (Свт. Иоанн Златоуст)


37:11: **Заметил это слово**. Отец его сохранил слово сие. То есть хотя Иаков и укорил Иосифа за его сон для успокоения братьев его, но сам тщательно наблюдал, не Бог ли открывает чрез него будущее (Свт. Филарет (Дроздов))

37:12: **Israel**. Jacob is 108 years old now. Isaac was still alive at this moment, but Isaac will die before Joseph reunites with his family in 22 years from this moment.




















### Joseph Sold by His Brothers

37:2: **Рувим, Симеон, Левий**. Рувим, Симеон и Левий: это как раз те три сына, которые уже показали себя не лучшим образом. Один спал с наложницей отца; другие устроили резню; трое тем самым показали, что авторитета отца для них не существует. И они теперь лишены наследства.
В этой семье нет ни мира, ни доверия. И потому отец отправляет Иосифа проверить, что там происходит. (МЦЦ)

37:12: **Pasture the flock .. near Shechem**. Joseph’s brothers have taken the family flocks northward from Hebron to find better pasture. (ESV)

37:13: **Here I am.** In the OT the phrase indicates complete readiness. Joseph exhibits readiness to obey his father.

37:14: **see if it is well with your brothers**. Looks like Joseph has had a reputation of bringing reports to his father. And Jacob seems to distrust those sons of his.

37:14: **Shechem**. There's over 100km from Hebron to Shechem. Why would anyone travel that much with the flock? Did they have some business in Shechem, the city they had plundered just a few years ago? Why would anyone even want to go to that land after such a story? Perhaps, that is the reason why their father was worried?

37:17: **Dothan**. What has made them change their plans?

37:17: **Dothan**. Another 26-32 km north. (ESV)

37:18: **To kill him**. What a hatred.
Fratricide is a repeated theme in Genesis and represents the presence of sin in the fallen humanity.

37:18: **Стали умышлять против него, чтобы убить его**. Видишь ли, они решились убить его, опасаясь исполнения его снов? (ст. 20) Но они должны были научиться, что предвозвещенное самим Богом не может не совершиться. Они совещаются между собою, составляют замысел, обнаруживая свою злобу; а премудрый и благопромыслительный Бог устрояет так, что сами же злоумышленники невольно содействуют совершению будущих событий. (Свт. Иоанн Златоуст)

37:19: **Сновидец**. Еврейское выражение *владыка снов* (Hb. *baal*) более знаменательно и более укоризненно для Иосифа. В нем, как думает Абарбенел, заключается мысль братьев, что Иосиф выдумал сны свои. (Свт. Филарет (Дроздов))

37:21: **Reuben**, the firstborn, saves his brother's life. The one who probably had more reasons to hate Joseph than everyone else.

37:21: **Reuben**. Reuben possibly hopes to regain his father’s favor (after sleeping with his wife) so that he will be confirmed as the firstborn; or perhaps Reuben has no other motive than to show mercy to Joseph. (ESV)

37:21: **Рувим** как старший, считал себя особенно ответственным перед отцом за младших братьев, в особенности за любимца отца — Иосифа. (Лопухин А.П.)

37:22: **throw him into the pit .. that he might rescue him**. Reuben had no hatred for Joseph, or at least he did not let himself act out of that hatred. Nevertheless, he couldn't confront his brothers openly.

37:22: **shed no blood; throw him into this pit**. Reuben appealed to their sense of mock morals, stating that leaving a person to death is fine, while shedding blood is not. 

37:24: **Бросили его в ров**. Бросили его, конечно, при отчаянном вопле его о сострадании (Быт 42:21: "И говорили они друг другу: точно мы наказываемся за грех против брата нашего; мы видели страдание души его, когда он умолял нас, но не послушали") (Лопухин А.П.)

37:24: **ров же тот был пуст; воды в нем не было**. Бросили его в ров пустой, без воды, но едва ли без жидкой грязи на дне этого рва — цистерны, полной, может быть, разных гадов: скорпионов, змей (Лопухин А.П.)

37:25: **Sat down to eat**. This underlines the callousness of the brothers, who have just thrown their brother into a pit, and are now having a pleasant time. (ESV)

37:25: **сели они есть хлеб**. Рувим в этом время отсутствует.

37:25: **караван**. Откуда там вообще взялся караван? Почему братья ушли из Сихема? Зачем было из проверять?
Вполне возможно, что, лишённые наследства, трое братьев приторговывали скотом как раз с тем караваном. Отсюда и идея про продажу брата, и потому сделка так легко состоялась: братья уже знали водителей каравана. (МЦЦ)

37:25: **стираксу, бальзам и ладан**. Все эти продукты в сыром виде везлись в Египет, где и приготовлялись из них пряности; позже Иаков (Быт. 43:11) послал этих продуктов в дар Иосифу. (Лопухин А.П.)

37:26: **what profit is it if we kill our brother?**. Judah's raising of this question means that the brothers were still plotting to kill Joseph, despite Reuben's suggestion in v. 22. They've done as Reuben said, but they didn't leave the idea of killing.
The murder they planned is cold and premeditated. It's not momentary rage upon seeing Joseph: they're planning it.

37:26: **И сказал Иуда братьям своим: что пользы, если мы убьем брата нашего и скроем кровь его**. Рувим и Иуда, храня верность священным законам братства, захотели избавить Иосифа из рук. И весьма справедливо Иуда был предпочтен отеческим благословением, когда ему говорится: поклонятся тебе сыны отца твоего, молодой лев Иуда, и ему покорность народов (Быт. 49:8-10). (Свт. Амвросий Медиоланский)

37:27: **Let not our hand by upon him**. Another example of that mock morals, when suffering caused to a person by the hand of someone else seems acceptable.

37:27: В Истории Иосифа есть много черт, по которым невольно переносишься к Господу нашему Иисусу Христу. Особенно замечательно сходство в лицах, продавших Иосифа и Господа. Оба – Иуды, и оба продали за деньги. (Прав. Иоанн Кронштадтский)

37:27: **Sell him to the Ishmaelites**. Apparently this was a known activity in the region: e.g., one Ugaritic text, from the 14th century B.C., tells of a man in Syria being sold by his comrade to a passing caravan of Egyptians—who stripped him of his goods and abandoned him. (ESV)

37:27: **Sell him**. We do not know whether Judah is motivated by compassion, or greed for profit.

37:27: **Пойдем, продадим его Измаильтянам**. Иуда (в отсутствие Рувима) со своей стороны предлагает меру, которая, по его намерению, имела служить к спасению Иосифа от голодной, мучительной смерти в колодце. (Лопухин А.П.)

37:27: **Продадим его**. Продав Иосифа, братья его совершили преступление человекохищничества, за которое впоследствии закон Моисеев назначил смертную казнь. (Лопухин А.П.)

37:28: **Twenty shekels of silver**. Mesopotamian documents from the early second millennium B.C. reveal that the price of slaves ranged from 15 to 30 shekels. (ESV)

37:28: **Twenty shekels of silver**. Это за дёшево.

37:28: **продали Иосифа Измаильтянам**. Представь же себе, как этот дивный юноша, воспитанный среди множества слуг, постоянно бывший в объятиях отца, внезапно принужден нести тяжкое рабство, и притом у людей диких, которые не лучше самых зверей. Но Владыка всяческих и людей этих сделал кроткими, и ему дал великое терпение. (Свт. Иоанн Златоуст)

37:28: **продали Иосифа**. Продав брата, братья Иосифа находились в состоянии людей, достигших своей цели, потому что удалили от себя ненавистного им брата. (Свт. Иоанн Златоуст)

37:29: **Tore his clothes**. A visible sign of intense anguish and pain, often linked to mourning. Reuben’s grief and despair might center not on the loss of Joseph himself but on his own lost opportunity to regain his father’s favor. (ESV)

37:30: **Where shall I go?**. Reuben now openly says that he feels responsible for his younger brother.

37:30: **А я, куда я денусь**. Не найдя Иосифа в колодце, приходит в отчаяние, разрывает в знак нестерпимой печали одежду (как после сделает Иаков, ст. 34). 
В вопле его к братьям — enennu vaani ani anah ba — заключается непереводимый, свойственный еврейскому языку, ассонанс, выражающий непосредственную и глубокую скорбь доброй души Рувима, не имевшего, однако, достаточно твердости открыть отцу действительное положение дела. (Лопухин А.П.)

37:30: **Куда я денусь?** Рувим паче прочих сокрушается о Иосифе, как старший из братьев и потому обязанный пещися о всех прочих. Но скорбь его не есть еще чистое раскаяние, а только страх гнева отеческого; почему и сопровождается не признанием пред Иаковом, а обманом. (Свт. Филарет (Дроздов))

37:31: **закололи козла**. Р. Маймонид (выдающийся еврейский философ и богослов-талмудист, раввин, врач и разносторонний учёный) говорит, что в законе Моисея нередко требуется козел за грехи общества Израилева, для напоминания об этом обмане Иакова сыновьями его и для возбуждения в грешнике сознания необходимости очищения грехов. (Лопухин А.П.)

37:31: **Вымарали одежду кровью**. Они удовлетворили своей страсти, то вот теперь они стали придумывать все способы, как бы обмануть отца и скрыть от него свое преступное соумышление. Они за важное почитают только страх и стыд пред людьми в настоящей жизни, а не думают о будущем страшном суде и вечных невыносимых муках; они заботятся лишь о том, как бы избежать укоризны от людей. Так думали и эти и решились обмануть отца. (Свт. Иоанн Златоуст)

37:32: **Brought it to their father**. That was really cruel: had they said that "they didn't know where he was", the father might have had hope. But they've robbed him of hope. It is possible that they didn't want to lie openly, but found it acceptable to lie by tricking the father -- just as they found acceptable to sell their brother, but agreed that an unmediated murder is immoral. 

37:33: **Robe**. Jacob’s deception by his sons, using Joseph’s cloak and a slaughtered goat, mirrors the way Jacob had deceived his own father by using Esau’s cloak and two goatskins. (ESV)

37:33: **A fierce animal**. Note that the brothers didn't say a single lying word, but they've brought Jacob an item that made him think about death by fierce animal. In v. 20 we saw that this is what they initially were going to tell their father.

37:35: **His sons rose to comfort him**. The very sons that caused him this suffering are now trying to comfort him. Every word they must have said was either a blunt lie, or a huge discomfort to those who had to invent all sorts of falsehoods.

37:35: **утешить его**. Когда братья увидели горе отца... они стали жить с чувством вины. Представляете, каково это, долгие годы жить с чувством вины, которое никак не исправить, и о котором даже не рассказать?
Потому когда стало ясно, что Иосиф жив, они испытали настоящее освобождение. (МЦЦ)




















### Judah and Tamar

38:1: **Went down from his brothers**. A sense of foreboding is conveyed through Judah’s separation from the rest of his family, his friendship with **Hirah**, a native of the Canaanite city of Adullam (about 19 km southwest of Bethlehem), and his marriage to an unnamed Canaanite woman, the daughter of Shua. In Genesis, marriages to Canaanites are never applauded. (ESV)

38:1: **Adullamite**. Adullam was one of the royal cities of the Canaanites. (Wikipedia)

38:1: **Иуда отошел от братьев своих**. В родословную Мессии входят явные грешники. Христу, понесшему на Себе грехи всего мира и не возгнушавшемуся родиться от Адама-богоотступника, не тяжко было родиться и от Иуды–кровосмесника. (Свт. Филарет (Дроздов))

38:7: **Господь убил его**. Род смерти не показывается. И сие дает разуметь, что смерть безвременная и смерть бездетного вообще почиталась казнию от Бога. (Свт. Филарет (Дроздов))

38:8: **Go in to your brother's wife**. Levirate marriage. See Dt 25:5–10.

38:9: **So as not to give offspring**. The evil is not in the wasting of semen; the evil is in the heart that did not want to honor his brother. He still wanted sex, though.

38:9: **Onan knew that the offspring would not be his**. While publicly Onan appears to fulfill his father’s request, in private he refuses to father a child on behalf of Er. (ESV)

38:9: **So as not to give offspring to his brother**. A detailed explanation for his action is not given, but selfishness is the most likely explanation: he probably feared that a son born to Tamar would be privileged over all other sons born to him, reducing the importance of his own family line and reducing his share of Judah’s inheritance. (ESV)

38:11: **In your father's house**. Judah sends her back to her parents.

38:11: **He feared that he would die**. He treats Tamar as if she were dangerous, while it was actually the evil of the two sons that brought about their deaths. (ESV)

38:11: **Живи вдовою в доме отца твоего**. Представилось Иуде, что оба мужа Фамари погибли за ее грехи, и послал он ее в дом к отцу ее в надежде, что выйдет она замуж. (Прп. Ефрем Сирин)

38:11: **Пока подрастёт Шела**. Опасаясь, чтобы и этот, подобно братьям, не подвергся наказанию, Иуда не исполнял обещания. (Свт. Иоанн Златоуст)

38:11: **Пока подрастёт Шела, сын мой**.  Или это есть один предлог отказа, или в самом деле Иуда лучше надеялся сохранить третьего сына своего, если он вступит в супружество в возрасте более зрелом. Первое кажется справедливее, по признанию самого Иуды (Быт 38:26: "Иуда узнал и сказал: она правее меня, потому что я не дал ее Шеле, сыну моему."). (Свт. Филарет (Дроздов))

38:11: **Пока подрастёт Шела, сын мой**. Настоящей причиной был суеверный страх Иуды: взгляд на Фамарь, как на женщину, приносящую смерть тому, кто вступит с нею в брак (ср. Тов. 3:7–8; по позднейшему еврейскому обычаю женщина, у которой умерли уже 2 мужа, строго говоря, теряла право на 3-й брак). Протягивая время обещанием выдать Фамарь за Шелу, Иуда на самом деле обрекал ее на вечное вдовство (ст. 14), чем и причинял ей несправедливость, в которой после сам сознался (ст. 26). (Лопухин А.П.)

38:12: **стригущим скот его**. Время стрижения овец было у древних временем веселия и дружеских пиршеств (праздник стрижения овец; 2 Цар 13:22: "было стрижение овец .. и позвал Авессалом всех сыновей царских."; Быт. 31:19: "Лаван пошел стричь скот свой"). (Свт. Филарет (Дроздов))

38:14: **sat at the entrance**. It is possible that she did not anticipate the way the situation would develop, but was simply hoping to meet Judah and remind him about that she is betrothed to Shela. The meeting, however, presented another opportunity, which she had immediately used to her advantage. (ESV)

38:14: **she had not been given to him in marriage**. Judah did not forget; he refused on purpose: we know that because in v.26 he confirms that this would've been the right thing to do. Still, he had sent her away hoping that she'd forget. She didn't.

38:14: **Enaim** means "Two eyes" (or "two roads"). Given Tamar’s veil and Judah’s inability to recognize her, it is ironic that these events should take place at a location known as “eyes.” (ESV)

38:15: **Covered her face**. Since betrothed women wore veils, Judah’s belief that Tamar is a **prostitute** would not have been simply based on her covered face. Her lone presence by the roadside possibly contributed to his assumption. (ESV)

38:16: **What will you give me?**. It's hard to say whether she anticipated that Judah would break the promise of a goat (after not giving her to his son in marriage), or whether she actually planned to disappear in case she gets pregnant.

38:17: **печать твою**. На перстне, а равно на тростях, вероятно, весьма рано вырезывались разные эмблемы обладателя их (эмблемой или гербом Иудина колена был лев (Быт 49:9), Данова — змей (Быт 49:14), Иссахарова — осел (Быт 49:17), Вениаминова — волк (Быт 49:2)7). (Лопухин А.П.)

38:18: **вошёл к ней**. Никто, слыша это, да не осуждает Фамарь: как я уже сказал, она служила в этом случае орудием Промысла, – почему и она не подверглась какому-либо порицанию, и Иуда не предан осуждению. (Свт. Иоанн Златоуст) 
\[Златоуст склонен оправдывать действия всех и каждого, кто в итоге служит для исполнения Божьего Замысла. Но это странный ход мышления: очевидно, что Бог способен даже использовать грех человека для продвижения своих целей вопреки. Грех при этом не оправдывается исходом; только раскаянием.\]

38:18: **перевязь**. То, на чем носили печать. (Свт. Филарет (Дроздов))

38:18: **Вошёл к ней**. Вступление Фамари, Раавы (блудницы), Руфи (все не-евреи) в род Мессии есть предзнаменование и некоторое частное предварение обращения к Нему церкви языческой. (Свт. Филарет (Дроздов))

38:21: **Блудница**. На еврейском поставлено здесь особливое имя קדשה. По его происхождению и употреблению (Ос. 4:14) оно долженствует означать посвященную Астарте или другому подобному божеству.
Это была самая опасная хитрость отца лжи, что он умел не только представить грех позволительным, но и освятить его. 
(Свт. Филарет (Дроздов))

38:24: **Let her be burned**. Judah had accepted his own failure to provide her with a husband, but is immediately ready to execute harsh punishment on another person.
The story turns around: Judah has to acquit the woman and accept his own failure.

38:24: **Пусть сожгут её**. Между тем по закону Моисееву нарушительница супружеской верности была побиваема камнями (Втор. 22:21), сжигалась же только впавшая в блуд дочь священника (Лев. 21:9; поэтому традиция иуд. считала и Фамарь дочерью священника, по раввинам — дочь Сима или Мелхиседека). 
Возможно, наконец, что сожжение Иудою было назначено Фамари, как (предполагаемой) жрице Астарты (Втор. 7:25; 12:3). 
(Лопухин А.П.)

38:25: **Когда повели её**. Фамарь посылает вещи деликатно, не называя его имени, напоминая о случае. Талмуд и Мидраш, восхваляя эту заботливость Фамари о добром имени свекра, в то время когда ей самой угрожала смерть, выводят нравоучение, что лучше умереть, нежели опозорить ближнего. (Лопухин А.П.)

38:25: **Когда повели её**. Из выражения «когда повели ее» Мидраш заключает, что упомянутые вещи ее уже пропали, но Бог чудесно даровал ей другие подобные. (Лопухин А.П.)

38:26: **Иуда сказал**. Скромное напоминание Фамари пробуждает в Иуде упреки совести и он (по вдохновению свыше, говорит Мидраш) открыто, всенародно признает свою виновность перед Фамарью (Лопухин А.П.)

38:26: **она правее меня**. не то сие значит, чтоб Иуда признавал Фамарь совершенно невинною, но что себя самого находит он более виновным, нежели она. (Свт. Филарет (Дроздов))

38:26: **она правее меня**. Фамарь не может быть оправдана, потому что она должна была видеть в совокуплении с самим Иудою прелюбодеяние и кровосмешение; и потому что лучше было ей за претерпеваемую несправедливость ожидать возмездия от Промысла, нежели коварство противопоставлять коварству и беззаконию беззаконие. (Свт. Филарет (Дроздов))

38:26: **Она правее меня**. Поскольку, когда многие, скрывая свои прегрешения, осуждают других, Иуда произнес приговор на себя, а ту, которую сочли любодейцею, избавил от наказания, то за сие справедливо удостоился он царства: за нелицеприятный суд и правый приговор. Право священства принадлежит не старшинству, но добродетели. (Прп. Исидор Пелусиот)

38:29: **Perez**.  Later, in ch. 49, kingship will be associated with Judah’s descendants, and biblical history reveals that from Perez comes the Davidic dynasty (see Ruth 4:18–22). (ESV)

38:29: **Фарес**. "Фарес" разорвал оболочку последа, за что получил имя «разделение». Поэтому и фарисеи, которые якобы в силу своей праведности отделяли себя от народа, назывались «отделённые». (Блж. Иероним Стридонский)




















### Joseph and Potiphar's Wife

39:2: **The Lord was with Joseph**. Implicit in this account is the idea that God’s presence with Joseph is linked to Joseph’s commitment to the Lord. (ESV)

39:2: **The Lord was with Joseph**. Although God never speaks directly to him (as he did to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob), Joseph’s life in Egypt is governed by God’s providential care (Gen 50:20: "you meant evil against me, but God meant it for good, to bring it about that many people should be kept alive"). (ESV)

39:2: **Был Господь с Иосифом**. Как он, еще юный, не привыкший к такому тяжкому образу жизни, воспитанный дома со всею отеческою любовию, переносил это жестокое рабство? Писание присовокупляет: «И был Господь с Иосифом: он был успешен в делах». Благодать свыше сопутствовала ему и все трудности делала для него легкими. Она устрояла все, что касалось его. (Свт. Иоанн Златоуст)

39:2: **Был Господь с Иосифом**. Иудейские толковники понимают так, что, оторванный от отца и родной семьи, Иосиф постоянно имел Бога в мысли и сердце своем, почему и Бог, как Отец небесный, являл ему особое попечение (Лопухин А.П.)

39:2: **The Lord was with Joseph, and he became a successful man**. Echoes the story of Jacob, who had become successful while being a servant for Laban.

39:2: **became a successful man**. In spite of having been sold into slavery, Joseph prospers. This means that he did not only have work, but also good conditions and personal possessions.

39:3: **His master saw .. that the Lord**. The master couldn't *see* that the success was due to the Lord's power; he could only *hear* the explanation from Joseph. This means that Joseph was a God-worshipper and didn't hesitate to express it even being a slave in a pagan land.

39:3: **The Lord .. the Lord**. The repeated references to **the LORD** in these verses emphasize that Joseph’s success is due to God’s presence with him.  (ESV)

39:4: **Снискал благоволение в очах его**. Не должно думать, чтобы в этих происшествиях было что-нибудь случайное, что-нибудь такое, что зависело только от причин человеческих: самих врагов и сами препятствия Бог заставляет служить Своим предначертаниям, чтобы показать нам, что никто не может воспрепятствовать исполнению Его воли. Итак, когда тебя преследуют, не отчаивайся, не ропщи, не ожидай конца искушения и будь уверен, что Бог и само гонение может обратить в твою пользу. Все, чего Он от нас требует в этом случае, есть непоколебимое терпение. (Свт. Филарет (Дроздов))

39:4: **поставил его над домом своим**. Он облекает его полным доверием и властью в доме и делает надсмотрщиком над своими рабами. Надзиратели этого рода часто встречаются изображенными на египетских скульптурах. (Лопухин А.П.)

39:5: **blessed .. for Joseph's sake**. Same story happened with Jacob: Laban's household was blessed for Jacob's sake (Gen 30:27: "the Lord has blessed me because of you").
This second case demonstrates that God's blessing to a righteous person may yield fruit to those around him.

39:5: **blessed the Egyptian's house**. By indicating that divine blessing comes through Joseph, the narrator picks up on one of the important elements of the promises made to the patriarchs (Gen 12:3: "I will bless those who bless you"; Gen 18:18: "all nations shall be blessed in him \[Abraham\]") (ESV)

39:5: **благословил .. ради Иосифа**. «Всюду, куда приходят праведники, идет с ними шехина», замечает Мидраш по поводу слов священного писателя о благословении дома Потифара ради Иосифа. (Лопухин А.П.)

39:6: **had no concern about anything**. This tells us about the character of Joseph: he was a responsible, reliable, and hard-working person, even when it came to managing something that's not his.
Again, Joseph displays the same character that the new Jacob had: he worked for Laban while not having any livestock of his own.

39:6: **Кроме хлеба, который ел**. Сие, как думает Абен–Езра, не было поручено Иосифу потому, что египтяне с евреями в пище не сообщаются (Быт 43:30: "ибо Египтяне не могут есть с Евреями, потому что это мерзость для Египтян"). (Свт. Филарет (Дроздов))

39:8: **he refused**. Joseph’s refusal to lie with her contrasts sharply with the behavior of Reuben and Judah (Gen 35:22: "Reuben went and lay with Bilnah his father's concubine"; Gen 38:15–18: "Judah .. thought she was a prostitute")). His integrity does not permit him to betray his master by committing adultery. (ESV)

39:9: **How can I do this great wickedness**. Joseph exercises authority without seeing this as an opportunity to betray or exploit others. (ESV)

39:9: **against God**. Here Joseph again demonstrates his God-fearing attitude. The main reason is not a betrayal of confidence of a person, but sinning against God.

39:10: **or to be with her**. He tried to avoid her company.

39:12: **caught him by his garment**. The episode may seem ridiculous, but it only looks so because the seductive specifics of a horny behavior are omitted.

39:12: **его .. одежду**. Опять Иосиф оклеветывается из-за одежды. Прежде, братья, взяв его одежду, при помощи ея злодейственно клеветали на него, что он растерзан зверями; теперь женщина, взявши одежду, оклеветывает его в блудодеянии.  (Свт. Григорий Нисский)

39:14: **кликнула домашних своих**. Мстит ли только неистовая женщина за себя или предваряет обличение себя от Иосифа? 
\[(То есть, оклеветала ли она его только из мести, или же она сама боялась, что рассказ Иосифа мужу может навлечь беду на неё, и решила его опередить в целях самозащиты?)\]
(Свт. Филарет (Дроздов))

39:14-15: **He has brought among us a Hebrew to laugh at us**. She tries to maximize her case with 1) putting some blame on her husband (**he has brought**), 2) emphasizes Joseph's **Hebrew** origin to exploit the long-standing racial tension, 3) she portrays Joseph’s action as being directed against the entire household ("laugh at us"). (ESV)

39:15: **this garment**. As before, Joseph's garment is used to deceive people (last time -- his father). (ESV)

39:17-19: **The Hebrew .. whom you have brought. .. your servant treated me**. Once again she focuses on the non-Egyptian background of Joseph (v. 17: **Hebrew**), her husband’s poor judgment in bringing him into the household (v. 17: **whom you have brought**), and Joseph’s exploitation of her (v. 17: **laugh at me**, v. 17; contrast v. 14, where she speaks of “laugh at us”). To place further pressure on her husband, she describes Joseph as **your servant** (v. 19). (ESV)

39:19: **put him in prison**. Potiphar could have killed Joseph, but he didn't. Was it because he thought that Joseph's transgression is forgivable? Or because he remembered the good service Joseph has done and repaid him with mercy?

39:19: **В темницу**. Как прежде Господь избавил Иосифа от желавших убить его братьев, и устроил так, что он был брошен в ров... так и теперь рука Вышнего удержала чужеземца, и не допустила его тотчас устремиться на убийство юноши. 
Когда вышняя десница являет свое промышление, тогда все делается легким и сносным, и люди жестокие оказываются кротчайшими. А помощь свыше приходит с щедростию тогда, когда и мы покажем много добродетели.
(Свт. Иоанн Златоуст)

39:19: **В темницу**. Потифар «воспылал гневом»; на кого — на Иосифа или на жену, не сказано. По иудейским толковникам, Потифар не поверил обвинению жены своей, потому что в противном случае он казнил бы человека, покусившегося осквернить его ложе; но он не хотел далее расследовать дело, избегая позора для себя и семьи своей. (Лопухин А.П.)

39:19: **Отдал его в дом темничный**. Как жизнь раба недорого ценилась в древности, то род наказания Иосифа показывает, что господин его едва ли был убежден в действительности его преступления; но, вероятно, жертвовал им прихоти своей жены и чести своего дома. (Свт. Филарет (Дроздов))

39:19: **В темницу**. не только временное благополучие не всегда бывает наградой добродетели, и несчастья не всегда бывают наказанием за грех, но и самые жестокие страдания и скорби, которые иногда, по неисповедимым судьбам Промысла Божия, претерпевают добродетельные, бывают для них путем к славе. (Свт. Филарет (Дроздов))

39:20: **в темницу**. Заключен был Иосиф, может быть, 28 лет от роду, так как после 2-летнего заключения, при возвышении на пост первого министра фараона, он имел 30 лет. (Лопухин А.П.)

39:20: **where the king's prisoners were confined**. While the reader is not immediately conscious of the significance of Joseph’s being imprisoned **where the king’s prisoners were confined**, this will prove significant for future developments. (ESV)

39:21: **The Lord .. showed him steadfast love**. Notice how God's love didn't protect Joseph from getting into prison for a crime he did not commit. God has put Joseph into these circumstances for a purpose: to lift him up afterwards, and to grow Joseph's godly character up in the meanwhile. Even one month in prison is a huge opportunity for spiritual growth.

39:21: **Gave him favor in the sight of the keeper**. God can not only arrange the circumstances, but also cause people to look favorably upon His people.

39:22: **всех узников**. Таким образом, не только сам Иосиф не чувствовал темницы, но и другим узникам он облегчил тюремные страдания. (Свт. Амвросий Медиоланский)

39:23: **Whatever he did, the Lord made it succeed**. This is a strong statement: every thing that Joseph started, was successful. What a blessing!

39:23: **Господь давал успех**. Он среди самых скорбей не имел никакого чувства горести; а благопромыслительная премудрость Божия изменила все неприятное (в приятное). Как перл, хотя бы брошен был в тину, показывает свою красоту, так и добродетель, куда бы ты ее ни свергнул, проявляет свою силу – и в рабстве, и в темнице, и в бедствии, и в счастии. (Свт. Иоанн Златоуст)




















### Joseph Interprets Two Prisoners' Dreams

40:1: **cupbearer, ... baker**. Both are responsible for dinners and had unique access to Pharaoh, and were trusted to keep him from being poisoned. (ESV) 

40:1: **cupbearer, ... baker**. As we will see, the cupbearer was in the end innocent, and the baker, guilty of this **offence**.

40:4: **начальник телохранителей**. Скорее всего, это не Потифар, потому что Иосиф был под гневом Потифара; а сей начальник телохранителей доверяет ему. Это либо другой начальник... либо Потифар не так уж и гневался на Иосифа: возможно, держать в темнице его заставляла только честь дома. (Свт. Филарет (Дроздов))

40:6: **saw that they were troubled**. This tells us that Joseph did more than feeding the prisoners. Being himself imprisoned, Joseph took real care of others. 

40:8: **we have had dreams**. In the ancient Near East, **dreams** were often viewed as a medium of divine revelation. But because of their imprisonment, the cupbearer and baker no longer have access to the “magicians” and “wise men” who might have been able to provide an interpretation. (ESV)

40:8: **Не от Бога ли истолкования?** По сказанию Геродота, египтяне сами думали, что искусство волхвования или гадания не принадлежит ни одному из человеков, но некоторым божествам (см. Быт. 41:38, где фараон считает так же). Иосиф, применяясь ко мнению собеседников, в то же время пользуется случаем прославить истинного Бога, раздаятеля дарований. (Свт. Филарет (Дроздов))

40:14: **please do me the kindness**. Joseph said that "interpretations belong to God" (v. 8), but here he asks for a favor because of his interpretation, as if it was his merit.

40:14: **вспомни же меня, когда хорошо тебе будет**. В истинности своего толкования Иосиф совершенно убеждён (Лопухин А.П.)

40:14: **вспомни же меня, когда хорошо тебе будет**. Августин говорит, что Иосиф изнемог верою, когда вместо ожидания помощи от Бога, ему присущего, прибегнул для избавления себя от бедствия к пособию человеческому, и что в наказание за сию неверность Бог попустил царедворцу забыть его. Но может быть, Иосиф просил его помощи не столько по собственной нетерпеливости, сколько по случаю, данному Провидением; и может быть, двулетнее после того продолжение заключения было не наказание погрешности, но только исполнение седмеричного искушения и очищения праведника, яко злата в горниле. (Свт. Филарет (Дроздов))

40:14: **вспомни же меня, когда хорошо тебе будет**. Слыша это, возлюбленный, не обвиняй праведника в малодушии; а лучше подивись тому, что он, среди таких скорбей, мужественно и благодушно переносил заключение в темнице. Все же его тяготило заключение и пребывание с людьми павшими и неопрятными. (Свт. Иоанн Златоуст)

40:15: **ничего не сделал**. Обрати здесь внимание на то, что он ничего не говорит касательно той гнусной блудницы, не обвиняет и своего господина, не упоминает о бесчеловечии к нему своих братьев. Он не пользуется возможностью обвинить других перед фараоном. О поступке жены своего хозяина он и вовсе не упоминает. (Свт. Иоанн Златоуст)

40:16: **увидел, что истолковал он хорошо**. Хлебодар не мог быть убежден в правильности толкования, которое еще ничем не могло быть проверено. (Лопухин А.П.)

40:16: **на голове у меня**. Несение корзин на голове — совершенно в духе древнеегипетских житейских обычаев: по Геродоту (2:38) мужчины у египтян носят тяжести на головах, женщины — на плечах. (Лопухин А.П.)

40:17: **birds were eating out of the basket on my head**. Perhaps, this is the reason why both were imprisoned: a case of theft.

40:17: **птицы клевали ее из корзины**. В отличие о виночерпия, хлебодар в несении своего служебного долга встретил препятствие, ущерб от птиц. (Лопухин А.П.)

40:19: **Снимет с тебя голову и повесит**. Египтяне осужденных сперва убивали, а потом вешали для поругания. (Свт. Филарет (Дроздов))

40:20: **Pharaoh’s birthday** may refer to his actual birthday or to the anniversary of his accession, when amnesties were more often granted. (ESV)

40:23: **не вспомнил .. об Иосифе**. Талмудисты в этом обстоятельстве видели божественное наказание Иосифу за его грех человеконадеяния, вместо надежды на одного Бога, и ссылались при этом на Пс. 39:5 ("Блажен муж, ему же есть имя Господне упование его"). Но подлинный высший прагматизм истории Иосифа, бесспорно, лучше понимает святой Иоанн Златоуст, говоря: «Иосифу нужно было (2 года) ожидать благоприятного времени, чтобы выйти из темницы со славой. (Лопухин А.П.)




















### Joseph Interprets Pharaoh's Dreams

41:1: **after two whole years**. According to Pirqei deRebi Eliezer §39, Joseph was in prison for ten years, meaning that he was 20 years of age when he was denounced, having served Potiphar for three years altogether. (Quora)

41:1: **after two whole years**. Joseph was 17 when he was sold (Gen 37:2). By now, Joseph is about 30 years of age (v. 46). Some of those 13 years he served in Potiphar's house. The rest of the time, he was in prison. ([GotQuestions](https://www.gotquestions.org/Joseph-in-prison.html))

41:1: **по прошествию двух лет**. Господь, как искусный художник, зная, насколько времени золото должно оставаться в огне, и когда его нужно вынимать оттуда, попускает виночерпию забыть об Иосифе в продолжение двух лет, для того, чтобы настало время для сновидений фараона, и праведник сделался бы известным всему царству. (Свт. Иоанн Златоуст)

41:2: **Из реки**. Река = Нил. Коровы вышли из Нила, потому что плодородие Египта зависело от Нила. В первом эпизоде Нил даровал жирненьких коров, во втором, Нил даровал голодных коров. (Свт. Филарет (Дроздов))

41:2: **Вышли из реки семь коров**. Рогатый скот в жарких странах подолгу остается в воде. (Лопухин А.П.)

41:5: **и снилось ему в другой раз**.  Сон второй посылается для уверения в божественности первого сна (Быт. 41:32: "А что сон повторился фараону дважды, это значит, что сие истинно слово Божие, и что вскоре Бог исполнит сие"). (Свт. Филарет (Дроздов))

41:5: **и снилось ему в другой раз**.  По понятиям древности, повторение сна значило тождество их смысла, безусловную сбываемость их, имело возбудить внимание фараона и веру его в провиденциальное значение сна первого. (Лопухин А.П.)

41:7: **проснулся фараон и понял, что это сон**. Живость образов обоих снов была столь велика, что лишь по окончательном пробуждении фараон понял, что виденное было сном. (Лопухин А.П.)

41:8: **his spirit was troubled**. The dreams share a common pattern of abundance followed by scarcity. The repetition of this theme troubles Pharaoh. (ESV)

41:8: **there was none who could interpret them**. How come no one "made up" some sort of explanation? Or was there a capital punishment for interpretations that did not come to pass?

41:8: **Не было никого, кто бы истолковал.**. Истолковать сны было нетрудно, но для того, чтобы истолкователем сна был Иосиф, сокрыт был смысл сна от мудрецов фараоновых. (Прп. Ефрем Сирин)

41:9: **Грех мой воспоминаю я ныне**. Или грех неблагодарности пред Иосифом, или грех пред фараоном. (Свт. Филарет (Дроздов))

41:13: **as he interpreted to us, so it came about**. This is the most important part: not that Joseph could tell what the dream meant, but that it came to pass the way he interpreted. This tells that both the dream and its interpretation came from God.

41:14: **out of the pit**. The expression **out of the pit** graphically illustrates what it was like for Joseph to be incarcerated in prison. (ESV)

41:14: **остригся**. Стрижка волос — черта специфически египетская, — египтяне отпускали волосы лишь в печали (Лопухин А.П.)

41:16: **It is not in me; God will**. Joseph is careful not to take any credit for the interpretation, even though it came from his lips and through his mind.

41:16: **God will give .. an answer**. God, not Joseph, is the one who will answer Pharaoh’s request. (ESV)

41:16: **ответ во благо**. В тексте самаритянском, сирском и у семидесяти речь сия имеет вид отрицательный, а смысл тот же: без Бога не дастся фараону мирного ответа. (Свт. Филарет (Дроздов))

41:19: **such as I had never seen in all the land of Egypt**. This is a new detail; Pharaoh must have thought the dream over and over.

41:21: **но неприметно было**. Плодородие первых семи лет не в силах будет покрыть своим излишком скудость 7 последующих лет голода. (Лопухин А.П.)

41:34: **one-fifth**. That is 20% tax. People would not be too happy about it.




















### Joseph Rises to Power

41:38: **In whom is the Spirit of God**. Pharaoh listen to the words of Joseph where he said that God gives interpretations. It is likely, though, that he perceived God of the Hebrews as one more entity in their pagan framework.

41:38: **Дух Божий**. Фараон усматривает источник мудрости Иосифа в Боге, и немедленно решает поставить Иосифа во главу государства. (Лопухин А.П.)

41:42: **ring, garments, gold**. This very morning Joseph was in the pit where he has spend a decade. Now, in just one day, he has the best comforts and is the second most powerful person in the country.

41:42: **перстень**. Перстень у древних был знамением не только некоторого начальства, но иногда и верховной власти. Так, Александр пред смертью подал свой перстень Пердикке, и сие принято было за знак унаследования. Так, Артаксеркс дал перстень Мардохею (Есф. 8:2). (Свт. Филарет (Дроздов)).

41:45: **called Joseph’s name Zaphenath-paneah**. The provision of an Egyptian name and a wife completes the process by which Pharaoh fully integrates Joseph into the royal court. (ESV)

41:45: **имя: Цафнаф-панеах**. Значение нового имени Иосифа — «спаситель мира» (по Иерониму и версии Семидесяти толковников), или «открыватель тайн» (по Иосифу Флавию), «питатель жизни», или «дух, обтекающий мир»; с точностью не установлено; во всяком случае новое имя Иосифа выражало ту мысль фараона, что Иосиф есть посланный Богом и имеющий послужить спасению Египта человек. (Лопухин А.П.)

41:45: **the daugher of the priest**. Joseph’s marriage to Asenath, the daughter of Potiphera priest of On, would have completed his assimilation into Egypt. By marrying into a prominent priestly family, Joseph would gain additional acceptance. (ESV)

41:45: **Асенефу, дочь Потифера, жреца**. С египетского — служительница богини Нейт ( египетская богиня охоты и войны). Иосиф, при сходстве с египтянами внешнего быта его, всегда оставался верен вере отцов. (Лопухин А.П.)

41:47: **приносила из зерна по горсти**. настоящие слова Моисея истолковать можно так, что в течение семи лет изобилия земля приносила от одного зерна такое множество стеблей и колосьев, которое казалось целым снопом. Сие не покажется невероятным тому, кто знает плодородие древнего Египта. (Свт. Филарет (Дроздов))

41:41-52: **for God, .. for God**. In naming his sons, Joseph demonstrates great joy over the way his life turned out, and great thankfulness to God who has done that. 

41:54: **Во всей земле Египетской был хлеб.** Иосиф наперед устроил так, что, когда должен был наступить сильный голод, египтяне не чувствовали нужды. (Свт. Иоанн Златоуст)

41:56: **стал продавать**. Он предпочел продавать хлeб, а не раздавать его даром тем, кто нуждался, потому что, раздарив его небольшому числу, он лишил бы хлeба весьма многих. Он держался той щедрости, которая обогащает всех. Если бы он раздал даром, то поля могли бы оставаться необрабатываемыми, так как пользующийся чужим (обычно) не радит о своем. (Свт. Амвросий Медиоланский)




















### Joseph's Brothers Go to Egypt

42:1: **Why do you look at one another?**. Probably, this phrase is the last part of a conversation that started with "what shall we eat?".

42:1: **Что вы смотрите друг на друга?** То есть для чего вы остаетесь в бесполезном недоумении и бездействии? (Свт. Филарет (Дроздов))

42:4: **Feared that harm might happen to him**. Benjamin, the youngest, was 22 years old at the time. Joseph was 30. Other sons were between 40 and 56 years old.

42:4: **Вениамина .. не послал**. Вениамина — этого единственного, после Иосифа, сына любимой Рахили — Иаков не отпускает из боязни какой-либо опасности для него в пути, извне или даже со стороны самих братьев. (Лопухин А.П.)

42:5: **among the others**. There were many.

42:6: **Начальник**. По–еврейски "שליט" шаллит. Еврейское имя имеет один корень с арабским именем Султан и показывает полновластного обладателя. (Свт. Филарет (Дроздов))

42:6: **Он продавал хлеб**. Хлеб продавался, без сомнения, в разных местах и разными начальниками; только под главным управлением Иосифа. Но почему же братья Иосифовы принуждены были доходить до самой столицы и самого Иосифа? Потому, конечно, что он себе одному предоставил рассматривать требования иностранцев, дабы удовлетворять их только по мере крайней их нужды из своих избытков. (Свт. Филарет (Дроздов))

42:7: **Spoke .. to them**. Through an interpreter (v. 23). This matter must have already been settled for Joseph by his servants.

42:7: **Говорил с ними**. следуя этикету, и говорил с ними через переводчика. (Лопухин А.П.)

42:7: **Spoke roughly**. It is possible that Joseph's initial reaction, roughness, was sincere unfriendliness. He was unprepared.

42:9: **Remembered the dreams**. What a striking moment it must have been. Imagine some sort of Deja Vu moment, but divinely inspired, and crystal clear.

42:9: **Remembered the dreams**. Struck by such a memory of divine inspiration, Joseph would immediately recognize that this whole situation is God's providence. This perhaps was a heavenly hint to act in a certain way. Not to be vengeful, at least.

42:9: **Тут вспомнил Иосиф сны**. То есть почувствовал внутренне, что они теперь сбываются, и признал в сем дело Божие. (Свт. Филарет (Дроздов))

42:9: **The nakedness of the land**. An idiom that alludes to the locations where Egypt would be most vulnerable to attack. (ESV)

42:9: **Вы соглядатаи**. Признав теперь свои прежние искушения благодеянием Промысла, он получил в то же время тайное внушение поставить в кратковременное искушение своих братьев для их исправления. (Свт. Филарет (Дроздов))

42:9: **Вы пришли смотреть наготу земли сей.** Подозрение благовидное, ибо самая опасная граница Египта была со стороны Палестины; и необходимое в Иосифе для Египтян, ибо внезапное благоволение к неизвестным пришельцам, его самого могло бы привести в подозрение у Египтян. (Свт. Филарет (Дроздов))

42:9: **Соглядатаи**. Братья Иосифа пришли целым караваном; наконец, обычай высылать соглядатаев прежде занятия той или иной земли отмечен не раз и в библейской древности.  (Лопухин А.П.)

42:11: **мы все дети одного человека**.  подразумевается, не рискнул бы послать всех своих сыновей лазутчиками и подвергнуть их через то опасности (Лопухин А.П.)

42:13: **двенадцать братьев; мы сыновья одного человека**. То есть «мы не посланники какого‑либо царства или народа; мы принадлежим к одному малочисленному племени. Как же можем мы быть опасны для Египта?» (Свт. Филарет (Дроздов))

42:13: **One is no more**. This is the lie they had to get used to through the years. It is notable, however, that they did not use to say "we are eleven", but carried their guilt with them with every confession.

42:13: **А одного не стало**. Выражение обоюдное, происшедшее, как кажется, от смущенной совести. Сыны Иакова не хотят признаться, что брат пострадал от них, и не смеют солгать, что он умер. (Свт. Филарет (Дроздов))

42:15: **By the life of Pharaoh**. Emotional outburst.

42:16: **Let him bring your brother**. Because the dream has not yet been fulfilled: there were 11 stars bowing, not ten. And they bowed twice in two different dreams, not once.

42:16: **your words may be tested**. Having 10 potential spies remain in the land also makes invasion less likely.

42:17: **In custody**. Joseph demonstrates his authority over them. (ESV)

42:18: **On the third day**. A man would find a peace of mind in the course of three days. 

42:18: **For I fear God**. Joseph did not know yet whether they had remorse or not. Perhaps, his heart felt like acting differently, but because of **God**, he did what he did.

42:18: **останетесь живы, ибо я боюсь Бога**. Видя иноплеменного властителя, из страха Божия удерживающегося от жестокости против пришельцев неизвестных и почитаемых соглядатаями, с какими угрызениями долженствовали они вспомнить: боялись ли Бога тогда, когда ожесточились против своего брата, почитая его соглядатаем своих поступков! (Свт. Филарет (Дроздов))

42:19: **Let one remain**. His initial idea was "let one go and the rest remain" (v. 16). He is stressed.

42:19: **один брат из вас пусть содержится в доме**. Иосиф смягчает свое определение, вероятно, для того, чтобы не причинить тяжкой печали отцу своему. (Свт. Филарет (Дроздов))

42:21: **We are guilty**. The brothers did not forget or let go what they did to Joseph. They had been feeling guilt for all these 13 years. This guilt lets the immediately recognize what some might call "karma" or "boomerang".

42:21: **точно мы наказываемся за грех**. посмотри, как теперь восстает неподкупный судия – совесть, хотя и никто их не обличает и не приводит на суд, и как они обвиняют сами себя. (Свт. Иоанн Златоуст)

42:21: **Наказываемся за грех**. Поскольку Иосиф знал, что без глубокого раскаяния не простится братьям грех убийства, то и раз, и два, и три он подвергает их целительным терзаниям, словно духовному огню. Он не ставил цели отомстить за себя, но хотел помочь им исправиться и освободиться от столь тяжкого греха. И прежде чем они исповедали свой грех и взаимными упреками раскрыли совершенное ими преступление, Иосиф не дал им узнать себя и не целовал их поцелуем мира. (Свт. Кесарий Арелатский)

42:21: **За то постигла нас скорбь сия**. Братья Иосифа счастливы тем, что и в греховном состоянии сохранили уверение о премудром и праведном Провидении. Сие уверение становится теперь источником их покаяния, очищения и спасения. Счастлив, кто умеет по их примеру изъяснять свои несчастия. (Свт. Филарет (Дроздов))

42:23: **Joseph understood them**. Joseph had not seen them for 13 years and did not know how they felt about what they did to him. This was the moment Joseph learned that they had remorse.

42:24: **Wept**. And forgave.

42:24: **Bound .. Simeon**. Joseph has chosen "one of them" to stay in Egypt by binding him.

42:24: **Simeon**. The second oldest son. Reuben was the oldest, but he was against the selling of Joseph.

42:24: **Семёна**. Иосиф не касается Рувима, как менее виновного; на Симеона же слагает всю тяжесть бедствия, конечно, как на виновного более прочих. Будучи старшим после первенца, Симеон мог бы, соединясь с сим, удержать и прочих от преступления; он сего не сделал. Судя по его свойствам, какие открываются из его поступка с Сихемлянами и из решительного отзыва самого Иакова (Быт. 49:5-7), можно догадываться, не он ли был первою причиною несчастия Иосифова. (Свт. Филарет (Дроздов))

42:25: **Replace the money**. Joseph understood that his own family was not doing well, so he couldn't take the money.

42:25: **А серебро их возвратить**. Может быть, Иосиф опасался, чтобы недостаток денег не затруднил второго путешествия братьев своих в Египет. (Свт. Филарет (Дроздов))

42:28: **Their hearts failed them**. The brothers interpret it as something that **God has done** with the intention of bringing further harm to them. (ESV)

42:28: **God has done**. Running through this section of the story is the idea that those who perpetrate evil cannot evade punishment forever. (ESV)

42:28: **Hearts failed them .. trembling**. Such a stress is punishment enough. And it won't be one moment; they'd live in this situation for days and days.

42:34: **you shall trade in the land**. Joseph did not say anything like this; this addition was probably made to convince their father.

42:35: **Увидев узлы серебра своего, и они, и отец их ужаснулись**. Сыны Иакова разделяют удивление и беспокойство с отцом, не открывая ему, что приметили серебро еще на пути, дабы он не сказал: для чего не возвратились в Египет и не отдали оного. (Свт. Филарет (Дроздов))

42:36: **Все это на мою беду**. Признавая себя одного несчастным, Иаков чрез сие самое упрекает своих детей или по некоторому подозрению, или по предчувствию того, что они не просто несчастны, а виновны. (Свт. Филарет (Дроздов))

42:37: **Kill my two sons**. Jacob is unlikely to entrust Benjamin to someone who cares so little for the lives of his own sons. (ESV)

42:37: **Убей двух сынов моих**. Залог уверения неправильный, однако свидетельствующий об усердии Рувима к отцу своему. (Свт. Филарет (Дроздов))

42:38: **My son shall not go down with you**. What a decision the father had to make! Risk one son's life to possibly rescue the other or lose them both, or let him stay home and leave the other one in captivity.

42:38: **He is the only one left**. That's a bad thing to tell to your children who have been envious their whole life.




















### Joseph's Brothers Return to Egypt

43:7: **Расспрашивал**. Не думай, говорят, что мы сами добровольно рассказали тому человеку о нашем семействе. Он, приняв нас за соглядатаев, задержал нас, и подробно расспрашивал о наших обстоятельствах; поэтому мы и сказали ему это, желая объяснить ему все по справедливости. (Свт. Иоанн Златоуст)

43:9: **Пусть останусь я повинным в грехе против тебя на всю жизнь**. То есть подвергаюсь гневу твоему без надежды прощения. (Свт. Филарет (Дроздов))

43:11: **take some of the choice fruits**. Despite the famine, Jacob knows what is the right thing to do. This was how he sought forgiveness with his own brother, Esau.

43:11: **возьмите с собою плодов земли сей**. Может показаться, что Иаков не имел представления о великолепии и роскоши дворцов египетских а видал лишь незначительных князьков Ханаана. Но эта черта весьма типична для древнего и даже для современного Востока, где явление подчиненных к властителю, вообще низших к высшему — без подарков признается выражением непочтительности и невежливости. (Лопухин А.П.)

43:11: **плодов земли сей**. евр. zimrat-haarez, «воспеваемое земли» — все, чем она славится у соседних народов. (Лопухин А.П.)

43:11: **мёд**. Мёд, разумеется, вероятно, не пчелиный, которого всегда много было в Египте, а сгущенный виноградный сок, и теперь известный у арабов под именем «дибс» (вроде т. наз. «рахат-лукума»), который и теперь в громадном количестве ввозится в Египет. (Лопухин А.П.)

43:14: **Бог Всемогущий**. Он предает и детей, и себя воле Божией и при этом призывает  Господа, называя Его Всемогущим (Ел-Шаддай), как это было во времена проявления великих, чрезвычайных милостей Аврааму (Быт. 17:1), затем и самому Иакову (Быт. 28:3). Во всех случаях жизни, особенно в трудных, требовавших чрезвычайной помощи свыше, обстоятельствах, патриархи обращались с молитвою к «Богу Всемогущему». Отсюда видно, сколько превратности жизни изменили некогда самонадеянного Иакова, научив его совершенной преданности Богу. (Лопухин А.П.)

43:14: **If I am bereaved of my children, I am bereaved**. Jacob postponed the solution of this situation as much as he could, and ultimately, came to a point where he could only do one thing, and trust God with the outcome, whatever it will be.

43:14: **А мне если остаться бездетным, то останусь.**. Бедствия и опасность приводят Иакова к совершенной преданности Богу, а сия преданность приведет к благому концу его бедствия. (Свт. Филарет (Дроздов))

43:16: **Joseph**. Time has passed. Joseph has known for a while already that his brothers have repented of what they had done to him. Now, he has nothing but warm feelings. But the brothers know nothing about it.

43:18: **They were afraid**. Naturally, the brothers had no idea that they're going to have such a warm reception. They still feared that harm might come.

43:22: **мы не знаем**. Братья объясняют домоправителю свою полную непричастность к этому делу и прося его обратить на это внимание, ввиду ожидаемого ими обвинения и, может быть, осуждения в рабство согласно правопорядку древности. (Лопухин А.П.)

43:23: **Your God**. See how Joseph's faith has spread through the house! It does not mean that the steward has become a believer, but these words at least mean that he knows God. 

43:26: **поклонились**. Поднесение подарков и падение ниц — обычные на Востоке формы приветствия лиц высокопоставленных, особенно властителей. В падении ниц всех братьев пред Иосифом с буквальной точностью исполнились давние сны Иосифа, в свое время послужившие источником злоключений Иосифа. (Лопухин А.П.)

43:31: **И подали ему особо, и им особо**. Три стола. Один для Иосифа, который, как первый вельможа, и притом член жреческой касты, по древнеегипетским обычаям, не должен был есть даже вместе с другими высокопоставленными египтянами, не говоря о чужестранцах, с которыми и всякому простому египтянину есть не позволялось. Другой стол для египетских сослуживцев Иосифа, так же не имевших возможности разделять трапезу с чужеземцами. Третий стол для 11-ти братьев. (Лопухин А.П.)

43:32: **потому что это мерзость для Египтян**. Не одних евреев, но, по свидетельству Геродота, и греков подобным образом чуждались египтяне, так что не вкушали даже мяса, греческим только ножом отрезанного, боясь, не осквернен ли сей нож резанием коровы, которую они почитали животным священным. (Свт. Филарет (Дроздов))

43:33: **Сели они**. Египтяне за столом сидели, а не возлежали. У евреем обычай возлежать вошел в царский период их истории, вероятно, под ассиро-вавилонским культурным влиянием (сравни: Ам. 6:4). (Лопухин А.П.)

43:34: **И посылались им кушанья**. По распространенному на Востоке обычаю, посылка кушаньев от старшего на пиршестве выражала (и теперь выражает) почет гостю с его стороны, и увеличенная порция означала особенно большое уважение хозяина к известному гостю. (Лопухин А.П.)

43:34: **А Вениамину дал часть впятеро больше**. Отличая Вениамина, Иосиф и удовлетворяет своей к нему любви, и отдает справедливость его непорочности, и в то же время испытывает, не возбудит ли сие зависти в братьях. (Свт. Филарет (Дроздов))

43:34: **И пили у него довольно**. Не пьянство сим описывается, но довольное употребление вина по обряду пиршества. Пьянство нетерпимо было в древнем Египте. (Свт. Филарет (Дроздов))

43:34: **И пили**. Отсюда — попутно — узнаем, что евреи патриархального периода не гнушались общением пищи с чужеземцами, как начали гнушаться в период подзаконный. (Лопухин А.П.)




















### Joseph Tests His Brothers

44:2: **Положи чашу мою**.  Иосиф приказывает домоправителю положить в мешок своего меньшего брата свою серебряную чашу — для того, чтобы иметь повод требовать от братьев оставления Вениамина в качестве раба (ст. 10) и затем испытать степень привязанности братьев к единоутробному брату Иосифа. (Лопухин А.П.)

44:2: **Put my cup**. I wonder how such a command looked like in the eyes of other Egyptians. Didn't it stain Joseph's reputation?

44:5: **practices divinatin**. Since these remarks are set in the context of an elaborate ruse, it is impossible to know whether they should be taken as reflecting something that Joseph actually did. Joseph clearly intends that his brothers should believe that he has powers of supernatural discernment. (ESV)

44:13: **разодрали одежды свои**. Мидраш замечает, что это было им возмездие за то, что они некогда заставили отца своего разодрать одежды (Быт. 37:34). (Лопухин А.П.)

44:15: **A man like me can practice divination**. Joseph probably explains his knowledge of their family (their ages, etc) with supernatural means. He did not dare to like saying "God showed me this", and he didn't directly say that he practices divination. He just said that potentially, he could. It's all about making an impression.

44:15-16: **a man like me can practice divination**. Now that he has created the impression that he can discover knowledge with divine help, his brothers may feel that they can no longer conceal their past actions. For this reason, Judah remarks, **God has found out the guilt of your servants** (v. 16). In all probability Judah has in mind the brothers’ treatment of Joseph, for he knows that they are innocent of taking the silver cup. (ESV)


44:16: **что нам сказать?**. Улики очень ясны, и чтобы более не раздражить владыку Египта своим оправданием и жалобою на коварство, обращается к его милосердию. (Свт. Филарет (Дроздов))

44:16: **чем оправдываться? Бог нашёл неправду [нашу]**. «Положение наше столь затруднительно, что мы не находим достаточного средства отвратить от себя подозрение; итак, умалчивая о справедливости или несправедливости настоящего обвинения нас в татьбе, признаем, что, конечно, Бог судил наказать нас за некий тайный грех, и потому готовы предаться своей судьбе».. (Свт. Филарет (Дроздов))

44:17: **К вашему отцу**. Иосиф настаивает на оставлении в рабстве одного Вениамина, а прочим братьям предоставляет идти свободными и невредимыми к отцу: здесь самый решительный пункт их искуса. Представлялся благовидный повод отделаться от любимца. Но в эту напряженную минуту с новою энергиею выступает на защиту Вениамина Иуда. (Лопухин А.П.)

44:33: **remain instead of the boy**. Note that Judah does not hesitate to fulfil his promise despite thinking that Benjamin is a thief.

44:33: **Let your servant remain instead of the boy**. The selfless attitude of Judah stands in sharp contrast to what he previously displayed when arguing that Joseph should be sold into slavery. (ESV)

44:44: **Итак, пусть я раб твой**. Эти слова тронули Иосифа и достаточно уже показали ему и почтение братьев его к отцу и любовь к брату. (Свт. Иоанн Златоуст)




















### Joseph Provides for His Brothers and Family

45:1: **открылся братьям своим**. Примирение Иосифа и братьев — это история превращения семьи Иакова в Израиль. Там , где было соперничество, вражда, хитрость и обман, теперь единство. 
Зачем это всё было? Потому что в том виде, в каком была эта семья, они не смогли бы стать Израилем. В них нужно было многое поменять. Потому что Бог делает что-либо для того, чтобы мы обрели будущность и надежду (Иер 29:11-13) (МЦЦ)

45:1: **could not control himself**. Moved by Judah’s speech, Joseph is unable to restrain his emotions. (ESV)

45:1: **Удалите от меня всех**. Удалите от меня всех. Иосиф уединяется с своими братьями не только по обыкновенному правилу благопристойности, дабы, дав свободу своим сердечным чувствованиям, не представить из себя позорища для иноплеменников и подчиненных, но и для того, чтобы не унизить в глазах Египтян своих братьев открытием их преступления. (Свт. Филарет (Дроздов))

45:2: **the egyptians heard it**. It must have been a loud event.

45:3: **I am Joseph**. The narrator makes no comment on whether Joseph’s overall strategy with his brothers was right. (ESV)

45:3: **Я Иосиф**. Нужно, по моему, удивляться здесь и твердости этого блаженного мужа, тому, что он до сих пор мог притворяться и не обнаружить себя, а еще более удивляться тем, как они могли устоять и открыть наконец уста, как не вылетела из них душа, как не поколебался их рассудок, как они не провалились в землю. (Свт. Иоанн Златоуст)

45:4-5: **Я - Иосиф. Не печальтесь**. Первой заботой Иосифа было — успокоить братьев и уверить их, что никакого мщения им с его стороны не последует. (Лопухин А.П.)

45:5: **do not be distressed**. Joseph attempts to dissipate their sense of guilt by stressing God’s role in sending him to Egypt in order to preserve the lives of his family. (ESV)

45:5: **Бог послал меня перед вами**. не по человеческому нечестию, поскольку не людьми он был предан на смерть, а Господом послан для жизни. (Свт. Амвросий Медиоланский)

45:5: **Бог послал меня**. Само собой разумеется, что, высказывая братьям свой благонамеренный софизм, Иосиф имел в виду, что они уже достаточно наказаны, раскаялись, а потому достойны прощения и от брата своего, и от Бога. Священное Писание здесь, как и во многих других местах, фактически выражает ту истину, что божественное промышление, не стесняя и не исключая свободы человеческих действий, пагубные следствия их предотвращает и направляет к добру. (Лопухин А.П.)

45:5: **Бог послал меня**. См. Быт 50:20: "вот, вы умышляли против меня зло; но Бог обратил это в добро".

45:6: **Не будут .. орать**. Возможно, что, предвидя продолжительный и всеобщий голод, правитель Египта запретил жителям сеять, чтобы не терять напрасно семян (Свт. Филарет (Дроздов))

45:7-8: **Бог послал меня**. Повторяя сие, Иосиф, к успокоению, показывает братьям, что не хочет и помнить, как был ими продан, а знает только то, что послан Богом. 
Слова **не вы послали меня сюда** должно понимать не как самостоятельную истину, но как чувствование Иосифа.
(Свт. Филарет (Дроздов))

45:7: **Положит вам останок на земле и сохранит вашу жизнь избавлением великим**. То есть положит вас в числе остающихся от глада на земле и сохранит вас в живых в великом числе, между тем как другие соседственные племена или совсем, или большею частью погибают. (Свт. Филарет (Дроздов))

45:8: **It was not you who sent me here, but God**. It is surprising how Joseph looks past his brothers' past wickedness and recognizes God's plan behind all these events. Even though the brothers meant harm, God has turned everything into good.

45:8: **Отцом фараону**. Титул «отец царя» для первого царского министра весьма распространен был на древнем Востоке: у персов, греков (1 Мак. 11:32), без сомнения, и у египтян. (Лопухин А.П.)

45:9: **не медли**. Иосиф торопит братьев привести к нему отца — из боязни не застать его в живых (Лопухин А.П.)

45:10: **Гесем**. Избрана Иосифом для евреев сия земля по близости к местопребыванию его самого, по обилию пажитей (Быт. 47:6), для отлучения евреев от египтян, которые ненавидели пастухов (Быт. 46:34), для удобности пришествия из земли Ханаанской и возвращения в нее. (Свт. Филарет (Дроздов))

45:12: **очи ваши и очи брата моего Вениамина видят, что это мои уста говорят с вами**. «Вы могли бы не верить, когда бы вам о мне пересказывали; но вы сами меня видите, и если бы отец мой не поверил вам, пусть поверит Вениамину». (Свт. Филарет (Дроздов))

45:15: **Целовал и плакал**. Он на ненависть отвечает любовью. (Свт. Кесарий Арелатский)

45:19: **возьмите себе колесниц**. В гористой Сирии и Палестине колесницы почти совсем не употреблялись. (Лопухин А.П.)

45:20: **Не жалейте вещей ваших**. Фараон и Иосиф советуют семейству Иакова не жалеть о предстоящей потере разной домашней утвари; все это оно имеет найти в Египте. (Лопухин А.П.)

45:24: **Не ссорьтесь**. Сим Иосиф запрещал им упрекать друг друга и как бы говорить: «Ты присоветовал ввергнуть Иосифа в ров» - или: «Нет, ты настаивал продать Иосифа, в узах и нагого, Аравитянам». «Как я, - разумел Иосиф, - простил всех вас, так и вы все простите друг друга, чтобы от ссор и укоризн настоящая радость наша не обратилась бы для вас в скорбь». (Прп. Ефрем Сирин)

45:25: **пошли [вверх]**. Нам следует обращать внимание на то, как в Писании в каждом случае используются выражения «подниматься» и «спускаться», поскольку при ближайшем рассмотрении оказывается, что в нем почти никогда не говорится о ком-либо, что он спустился к некоему святому месту, как не говорится о том, что кто-либо поднялся к некоему предосудительному месту. Эти наблюдения свидетельствуют о том, что Священное Писание не было составлено, как представляется многим, на необразованном и невозделанном языке, а было обработано сообразно Божественному учению; и служит оно не столько историческому повествованию, сколько вещам и смыслам таинственным. Найдешь, следовательно, что рожденные от семени Авраама спустились в Египет (ср. Быт. 42:3, 43:15) и, напротив, сыны Израиля поднялись из Египта. И в самом деле, Писание и о самом Аврааме так говорит: И поднялся Авраам из Египта, сам и жена его, и все, что у него было, и Лот с ним, на юг (Быт. 13:1). (Ориген)

45:26: **Иосиф жив**. Ранее, отец слышал от детей, что он умер. Теперь слышит, что он жив. И в том, и в другом случае, ему об этом рассказывают; он не видит своими глазами.

45:26: **Иосиф жив**. мысли его волновались и он рассказ братьев считал обманом. В самом деле, они сами прежде принесли одежду Иосифа, обагренную в крови козла, и уверяли отца, что сын его сделался добычею зверей, а теперь говорят, что он жив и начальствует над всем Египтом. Смутившись духом, Иаков размышлял сам с собою: что бы это значило? Если справедливо прежнее, то невероятно настоящее; а если настоящее верно и справедливо, то ложно прежнее. Смущало его особенно то, что прежде он слышал от своих детей одно, а теперь узнает от них другое. (Свт. Иоанн Златоуст)

45:26: **владычествует над всею землею Египетскою**. Иосиф попрал похоть, бежал роскоши, подавлял и укрощал всё то, что от вожделения плоти -- всё это и значит, *владычествовать над всею землею Египетскою*. И это есть то, что называется великим и вызывает восхищение Израиля. 
Если кто подчинит некоторые грехи плоти, а другим уступит и подчинится сам, нельзя сказать о таком, что он *владычествует над всею землею Египетскою*; но, слова ради, можно сказать о нем, что он, похоже, над одним, двумя или тремя городами владычествует. 
Но Иосиф, над которым не господствовало ни одно плотское желание, над всею землею Египетскою был князь и господин.
(Ориген)

45:27: **the spirit of Jacob revived. And Israel**. His spirit was so revived, that he is called Israel again.




















### Joseph Brings His Family to Egypt

46:1: **took his journey**. Israel moved out not because God has told him to, but following his own decision. He still offered sacrifices to God to show his thankfulness.

46:1: **Beersheba**. A place where his father Isaac and grandfather Abraham lived for a while. (ESV)

46:1: **принес жертвы Богу**. Слыша это, научимся тому, чтобы когда предпринимаем ли что-нибудь, беремся ли за какое-либо дело, или отправляемся в путешествие, – прежде всего возносить молитвенную жертву Господу, и не иначе, как испросив Его помощь, начинать предпринимаемое дело. (Свт. Иоанн Златоуст)

46:1: **И пришел в Беэр–шаву**. Не потому только, что чрез сие место лежал путь в Египет, но потому, что сие место Авраам освятил алтарем и богослужением (Быт. 21:33), а Исааку явился здесь Бог и обетованием утешил его во время искушения (Быт. 26:23-24). (Свт. Филарет (Дроздов))

46:1: **И принес жертвы Богу отца своего Исаака.** Намерение особенного сего богослужения можно полагать троякое: 
1) испросить молитвою помощь и благословение Божие на предприемлемое путешествие;
2) обновить жертвоприношением на алтаре Авраама наследственный завет с Богом и видимо запечатлеть веру в обетование, несмотря на отбытие в Египет; 
3) приготовить себя очищением и благоговением, и испытать, не благоволит ли Сам Бог, как прежде в подобных случаях, явиться и открыть волю Свою в деле толико важном. (Свт. Филарет (Дроздов))

46:3: **Do not be afraid to go down to Egypt**. Even though Israel decided to move out by himself, God confirms that this intention is blessed by Him.

46:3: **Do not be afraid to go down to Egypt**. Previously God had prohibited Isaac from going to Egypt during a time of famine (Gen 26:1-2: "There was a famine .. and the Lord .. said: Do not go down to Egypt"). Jacob may well have been reluctant to go there. (ESV)

46:3: **Я пойду с тобою в Египет**. "Я сам буду сопутствовать тебе, и все благоустрою для тебя". Заметь (божественное) снисхождение! Что может быть блаженнее того, чтобы иметь самого Бога сопутником? (Свт. Иоанн Златоуст)

46:3: **не бойся**. Всё, чего мог бояться Иаков, Господь усмотрел в этих словах:
1) опасностей путешествия, или нарушения Божьей воли. «Я пойду с тобою в Египет».
2) что обетование останется неисполненным. Но Бог сказал: «там произведу от тебя народ .. и выведу тебя обратно».
3) что Иаков мог не дожить до встречи. Но «Иосиф своею рукою закроет глаза твои».

46:4: **I will also bring you up again**. God reassures Jacob that his journey to Egypt will not undermine the divine promises that center on Canaan. (ESV)

46:4: **Я пойду с тобою в Египет, Я и выведу тебя обратно.**. : еще Аврааму было откровение, что потомки его будут пришельцами в земле чуждой, будут порабощены и угнетены, но затем возвратятся в Ханаан (Быт. 15:13–16: "И сказал Господь Авраму: знай, что потомки твои будут пришельцами в земле не своей, и поработят их, и будут угнетать их четыреста лет, но Я произведу суд над народом, у которого они будут в порабощении; после сего они выйдут с большим имуществом"). (Лопухин А.П.)

46:4: **в Египет**. Это переселение имело ввиду, во-первых, обособление избранной семьи от хананеян, смешение с которыми, уже начавшееся (Быт. 38:2: "И увидел там Иуда дочь одного Хананеянина, которому имя: Шуа; и взял ее и вошел к ней"), могло быть весьма пагубно для религиозной миссии потомства Авраамова; с другой — в Египте с его пренебрежением к азиатам достигалась эта изолированность избранного народа, а высокое состояние египетской культуры могло плодотворно влиять на этого носителя истинного богопочтения. (Лопухин А.П.)

46:10: **Сыны**. Список не полностью сходится с 1 Пар 4:24. Часть родов могли оскудеть и потому быть опущены; могло меняться произношение имён; у людей бывали вторые имена (напр. Иаков-Израиль, Исав-Едом, Гедеон-Иероваал); а так же евреи часто смешивали сынов и внуков по известной неопределённости их языка. (Свт. Филарет (Дроздов))

46:15: **thirty three**. The numbers do no add up, and there are difficulties whether *Dinah* and *Ohad* should be removed (since Ohad does not appear in the parallel lists of Num. 26:12-13 and 1 Chron 4:24, and Dinah is the only daughter mentioned). These observations indicate that the 33 mentioned is not intended as a total of the list just given. (ESV)

45:21: **Sons of Benjamin**. Some of the people mentioned here as sons are actually his grandsons (see Num 26:38-40: Ard and Naaman), who could have only been after their migration to Egypt, not before. This means that this genealogy is not supposed to add up to 70 or be chronologically correct: the author just used the opportunity to list all their names. 




















### Jacob and Joseph Reunited

46:29: **Fell on his neck**. They have not seen each other for some 14 (?) years.

46:30: **Die**. Why does Jacob speak about death all the time? Is it just because he is old? Do all old people speak about death that often?

46:28: **Judah .. ahead**. Once again, **Judah** takes the lead. Judah’s role as the leader of his brothers anticipates the blessing that his father will bestow on him (Gen 49:8–12) (ESV)

46:34: **Keepers of livestock**. Joseph ensures that they live separated from the Egyptians. The goal is not to conceal and integrate; the goal is to expose and separate. Joseph ensures that Pharaoh confirms his choice of Goshen.

46:33: **Скотоводами были от юности нашей**. Иосиф настойчиво советует им объявить фараону, что они природные номады, — как бы предупреждая их от искушения увлечения благами египетской культурной жизни. Указание на занятие отцов перед египетским фараоном имело особенную силу, так как при кастовости древнеегипетской жизни всякое занятие здесь было родовым, переходило от отца к сыну. Пастушеская же каста была низшая из семи. Ненависть была отчасти обусловлена тем, что номады Азии приносили в жертву тех животных, которых египтяне боготворили. Сами же египтяне более всего почитали земледелие. (Лопухин А.П.)

46:33: **from our youth**. This information may also have been designed to reassure Pharaoh that Joseph’s family would not endanger national security. (ESV)

46:34: **чтобы вас поселили в земле Гесем.**. чтобы через это они отделены были от поклоняющихся овцам и тельцам. (Прп. Ефрем Сирин)

46:34: **Мерзость для Египтян всякий пастух овец**. В Египте, кроме немногих мест, закалывать овец не позволялось, как свидетельствуют Геродот, Страбон, Плутарх, и Диодор. (Свт. Филарет (Дроздов))




















### Jacob's Family Settles in Goshen

47:1: **с мелким и крупным скотом своим**.  следовательно, достаточно состоятельны и не могут быть особенно обременительны для страны. (Лопухин А.П.)

47:6: **поставь их смотрителями над моим скотом**. искусством некоторых из братьев Иосифа, опытных скотоводов, он предполагает воспользоваться для улучшения скотоводства в его владениях. (Лопухин А.П.)

47:6: **моим скотом**. Египетские, как и вообще восточные цари составляли для себя часть доходов, содержа стада на землях, принадлежащих короне. (Свт. Филарет (Дроздов))

47:7: **blessed Pharaoh**. Not knelt, not bowed, but blessed.

47:7: **blessed Pharaoh**. Interesting: doesn't the greater bless the lesser? But Jacob serves God who is greatest, and can therefore bless earthly kings. Still, it may have been quite daring.

47:7: **Jacob blessed Pharaoh**. Can be interpreted as merely words of greeting and saying farewell. However, in Genesis, the special line of Abraham is viewed as mediating God’s blessing to others. (ESV)

47:8: **Сколько лет дней жизни твоей?** Может быть, потому вопрошает, что, по образу Иакова, старость его казалась глубокою. (Свт. Филарет (Дроздов))

47:8: **How many are the days of the years of your life?** Pharaoh’s inquiry about Jacob’s age may have been motivated by the belief that longevity was a sign of divine favor. (ESV)

47:9: **few**. While Jacob is now 130 years old, Abraham and Isaac lived to be 175 and 180, respectively. (ESV)

47:9: **evil have been the days of my life**. He left his father's house. Laban tricked him. There was conflict in his house. He lost his beloved wife. His children massacred a city. He used to think that his son Joseph is dead. It seems that the other parts of his life did not bring him joy because of that.

47:9: **sojourning**. Implies that they had no permanent abode. (ESV)

47:9: **кратки и несчастны**. жалоба Иакова на краткость и бедствия жизни может показаться малодушною и несообразною с свойственным сему патриарху доверием к Провидению. Но недоумение сие уничтожится, если речь Иакова к Фараону разрешится так: «Ты, по моему образу, почитаешь старость мою глубокою, но она не так многолетна, как жизнь моих предков. Причиною престарелого вида моего не столько лета, сколько несчастия и печали». (Свт. Филарет (Дроздов))

47:9: **кратки и несчастны**. Так, Иаков богоборец, друг Божий, жил на земле меньше отцов своих, и при всей краткости своей жизни он провел ее в самой глубокой горести. Не смущайтесь же, люди праведные, если временное пришельствие ваше на земле исполнено горестей и разных несчастий. Всеблагий Господь не забывает, но помнит вас. Легкое страдание ваше, по апостолу, производит в безмерном преизбытке вечную славу вам (2Кор. 4:17). У Господа нашего такой закон, что блаженствовать можем мы не иначе, как потерпевши много горя: многими скорбями подобает… (Деян. 14:22) за грехи. (Прав. Иоанн Кронштадтский)

47:10: **Jacob blessed Pharaoh**. For the second time.

### Joseph and the Famine


47:15: **пришли к Иосифу**. . Удивительно, что народ не захотел в крайности насильственным образом овладеть хранилищами хлеба. Или они были укреплены, или народ еще не был заражен язвою своеволия, свирепствующею в новейшие времена; или в Иосифе очень ясно все видели руку Божию и потому не дерзали восставать на него. (Свт. Филарет (Дроздов))

47:16: **пригоняйте скот ваш**. Как раз братья Иосифа недавно были поставлены начальниками над скотоводами.

47:19: **купи нас и земли наши за хлеб**. Жители становились арендаторами фараона: фактически, его крепостными рабами. 
Это действие Иосифа вызывало тяжкое осуждение со стороны многих толкователей. Но упрек этот в значительной мере ослабляется для Иосифа полной, по-видимому, невозможностью действовать иначе. Иосиф не имел полномочия и вообще не мог раздавать хлеб нуждающимся туземцам даром.
Более того, из ст. 25 видно, что жителям Египта этот исход не представлялся столь тяжёлым и унизительным.
Священнописатель, как всегда, ни хвалит, ни порицает деятельность Иосифа, но лишь констатирует действительные исторические факты.
(Лопухин А.П.)

47:20: **bought all the land**. While some scholars believe that Joseph exploits the people’s poverty, the response of the people, **You have saved our lives** (v. 25), shows that in these terrible circumstances the Egyptians view Joseph positively. (ESV)

47:20: **И досталась земля фараону**. Сходится с историческими фактами: в Египте земля принадлежала короне. Из сего повествования мы узнаём, как так вышло.

47:20: **одолевал голод**. Смотрите, как Писание различает святых. Про неправедных говорится, что *голод их одолеваел*; про святых же так не говорится, но лишь, *усилился голод на земле*. Их он не одолевал. Потому что для праведного есть упражнение в добродетели, то для неправедного - наказание за грех. 
"Я был молод и состарился, и не видал праведника оставленным и потомков его просящими хлеба" (Пс. 36:25); и в другом месте: "Не допустит Господь терпеть голод душе праведного" (Притч. 10:3). "Исполняющие волю Отца Небесного" (Мф 7:21) не могут страдать от неутолимого голода, и оттого Писание осмотрительно не говорит, чтобы страдали от голода те, кому, как оно знает, были ниспосланы знание Бога и пища небесной премудрости.
(Ориген)

47:24: **пятую часть**. Увидь египтян, отмеривающих взнос при помощи числа «пять», поскольку пять чувств насчитывается у тела, которому служит народ плотской, - ибо всегда египтяне поклоняются вещам видимым и телесным. 
А народ израильский почитает число «десять» как число совершенства - поскольку он принял десять слов Закона и, будучи связан силой Десятисловия, неизвестные этому миру таинства Божии щедро передал. 
Но также и в Новом Завете подобным же образом «десять» почитается: десять плодов Духа (ср. Гал. 5:22), и верный слуга протягивает Господину своему десять мин прибыли с оборота и получает в управление десять городов (ср. Лк. 19:16-17) 
(Ориген)

47:26: **пятую часть**. Польза постановления Иосифова видна в последующие времена Египта. Диодор замечает, что доходы с земель освобождали царей Египетских от необходимости обременять народ податями другими. (Свт. Филарет (Дроздов))

47:27: **were fruitful and multiplied**. The recurring motif of Gen 1:22 usually goes in association with divine blessing (1:22, 1:18; 9:1, 7; 17:20; 28:3; 35:11; 48:4). (ESV)

47:29: **вынесешь меня из Египта и похоронишь меня в их гробнице**. Многие малодушные люди, когда мы убеждаем их *немного* заботиться о погребении и не считать делом стоящим особенного попечения, противопоставляют нам эту историю, и говорят, что и патриарх имел такую заботливость об этом деле. Но надобно обратить внимание, что  праведник этого желал не без цели, но внушая своим сынам благие надежды, что они некогда, хотя не скоро, возвратятся в землю обетования. 
Итак, никто не должен думать, что это распоряжение было делом малодушия.
(Свт. Иоанн Златоуст)

47:29: **Не похоронишь меня в Египте.**. Здесь намерение деятельно показать своему дому, что его мысли и желания не должны быть привязаны к Египту, но непрестанно устремлены к земле обетованной. (Свт. Филарет (Дроздов))

47:31: **bowed**. Possibly: in worship; in gratitude; because of frailty. (ESV)

47:31: **bed**. Septuagint has "the head of his staff” because the Hebrew word is the same (sans vowels). This reading is important because this is how an apostle quotes it in Heb 11:21.

47:31: **постели**. В 48 главе говорится, что Иаков прикован был к смертному одру (Лопухин А.П.)






















### Jacob Blesses Ephraim and Manasseh

48:1: **is ill**. Joseph merely comes with his **two sons** to visit his **father** who is **ill**. There is no hint at this stage of the important developments that are about to take place. (ESV)

48:3: **благословил меня**. Имеет намерение взять себе и тем по необходимости приобщить к своему пришельствующему племени двух сынов Иосифа, которые многого могли бы надеяться в Египте от фараона; Иаков представляет на сие высокое полномочие от Бога всемогущего и обетованием его убеждает Иосифа отвергнуть прельщение видимых выгод. (Свт. Филарет (Дроздов))

48:4: **I will give this land to your offspring**. When declaring Joseph's sons as his own, Israel has this promise of God in mind. This is how Ephraim and Manasseh, though not born of Israel, are counted as tribes and have their portion of land allocated.

48:4: **an everlasting possession**. What year is it today? Does Israel own the land? Yes; God's promise still holds, even though there was a long pause because Israel did not receive the Messiah.

48:5: **now your two sons .. are mine**. Joseph through his descendants receives one-sixth of the territory. This double portion of the inheritance confirms that Joseph was designated the “firstborn” in place of Reuben.
See 1 Chr 5:1: "Reuben .. his birthright was given to the sons of Joseph the son of Israel .. ; though Judah became strong among his brothers and a chief came from him, yet the birthright belonged to Joseph)".
(ESV)

48:5: **now your two sons .. are mine**. It may seem like Jacob is trying to bring more people under the immediate blessing, but, as will become clear from the rest of this chapter, he is not doing this apart from God's will. His actions are prophetic.

48:5: **ныне два сына твои .. мои**. Кажется, что Иаков желает Иосифу дать сугубое наследие, как первенцу от своей первой и единственной, по свободному избранию, супруги. Но дабы не огорчить его братьев, Иаков поступает иначе: вместо того чтобы при наследовании земли обетованной получить им одну долю под именем Иосифа, каждый из них, наравне с естественными сынами Иакова, получит по целой доле. (Свт. Филарет (Дроздов))

48:5: **Ефрем**. Царство в потомстве Иакова им отдано было Иуде, а священство — Левию (Быт. 49:8-9), но особым благословением его над Ефремом (Быт 49:14, 20) было предсказано ему, что и из его рода произойдут цари. (Лопухин А.П.)

48:6: **которые родятся после них, .. под именем братьев своих будут именоваться в их уделе**. Уже не составят отдельного колена, а будут причислены к коленам Ефрема и Манассии. А других детей у него, по всей видимости, не было. (Лопухин А.П.)

48:7: **умерла у меня Рахиль**. Трудно угадать, к чему здесь Иаков упоминает о смерти Рахили. (Свт. Филарет (Дроздов))

48:7: **умерла у меня Рахиль**. Ради памяти Рахили, для прославления ее имени, Иаков, через усыновление внуков, как бы преумножает число сынов любимой жены. (Лопухин А.П.)

48:9: **God has given me**. Even though they were born of a daughter of an Egyptian priest. We see in the Bible that people from pagan nations would join God's people. Some of them are even ancestors of Jesus (e.g. Ruth).

48:12: **поклонился**. Поклонялись Иакову, вероятно, все трое, так как невероятно чтоб Ефрем и Манассия оставались совершенно пассивными. Так читается в текстах самаритянском, греческом и сирском. (Лопухин А.П.)

48:14: **crossing his hands**. It may well be that Jacob really mistaken Ephraim for Manasseh, and only after the fact God gave him the confidence that what seems to be a mistake actually is not.

48:15: **Благословил**. По всем канонам, отец должен был бы на старости лет благословить своих детей. Особенно старшего, перворожденного. Но раз уж тот "провинился", то кого-то следующего. А здесь Израиль поступает совсем необычно: вместо сынов, он благословляет внуков!

48:15: **И благословил Иосифа**. То есть в лице двух сынов Иосифа Иаков благословил его со всем его потомством. (Свт. Филарет (Дроздов))

48:15: **God who has been my shepherd**. "I shall not want.". Ps 23.

48:16: **the angel who has redeemed me from all evil**. "I will fear no evil, for you are with me." Ps 23. He followed two verses from the psalm.

48:16: **in them**. Not in any of the other children, not even but **in them**. This is the transfer of firstborn-hood and God's blessings.

48:16: **Abraham and Isaac**. Note that Jacob does not mention any other names beyond that, e.g. Terah, because God's blessing only started with Abraham. It is that special blessing that is in view here.

48:18: **Не так, родитель мой**. Иосиф и сам пророк, как Иаков, но вот случай, который показует, что пророк не всегда может быть пророком, когда пожелает. (Свт. Филарет (Дроздов))

48:19: **I know, my son, I know**. Prophetic words. At this moment, Jacob must have had a revelation to speak and act this way.

48:19: **I know**. Jacob is emphatic that Ephraim should be blessed as the firstborn ahead of Manasseh. Subsequent history reveals that the Ephraimites become one of the leading tribes, with Joshua guiding the people into the Promised Land. But the Ephraimites are later rejected by God in favor of Judah (see Ps 78:67-68: "He rejected the tent of Joseph; he did not choose the tribe of Ephraim, but he chose the tribe of Judah.") (ESV)

48:19: **his younger brother shall be greater than he**. Recurring theme in Genesis: the older shall serve the younger

48:19: **shall be greater**. **Ephraim** numbered 40 500, whereas Manasseh numbered 32 200 (Num 1:33,35 and Num 2:19,21).

48:19: **Эфраим**. По рассечении царства Израильского на два колено Эфраимово было главою в царстве десяти колен (3 Цар. 12:25). Всегда отличалось оно наипаче воинскою силою (Суд. 8:2; Суд. 12:1; Пс. 77:9). (Свт. Филарет (Дроздов))

48:19: **Манассия**. Манассиино колено долгое время не уступало Ефремову ни в количестве своих членов, ни в могуществе, и одно оно из всех колен могло разделиться на 2 половины, западно-иорданскую и восточно-иорданскую, из которых каждая была очень могущественна.
Только уже после Ефремово колено приобрело гегемонию в средней (по географическому положению) группе колен Израилевых. Из него вышел славный вождь Израиля Иисус Навин, а из Манассиина — Гедеон. 
(Лопухин А.П.)

48:20: **Благословил их**. Иаков сделал невозможными после его смерти споры между сыновьями его о непринадлежности к семье обетования сынов Иосифа, как рожденных им от дочери жреца египетского. (Лопухин А.П.)

48:20: **тобою будет благословлять Израиль**. Благословение сделается образцом в Израиле для благословений отцами детей. (Лопухин А.П.)

48:22: **mountain slope that I took**. A reference to the massacre at Shechem.

48:22: **один участок, который я взял из рук Аморреев мечом моим и луком моим**. Нельзя видеть здесь указание на Сихемскую резню, потому что она была строго осуждена Иаковом в свое время (Быт. 34:30), и будет вновь осуждена им на смертном одре (Быт. 49:5–6). (Лопухин А.П.)

48:22: **мечом моим**. Сихемскую резню устроил не он. Более того, из той земли они немедленно ушли. Она теперь не может принадлежать ни ему, ни его сыновьям. И Сихемская резня была не с Эморреями. Значит, речь идёт о каком-то другом участке.

48:22: **участок**.  По–еврейски שחם шехем. Семьдесят толковников думали, что это Сихем. В самом деле, речь идет о земле, принадлежавшей Иакову недалеко от Сихема. (Свт. Филарет (Дроздов))


### Jacob Blesses His Sons

49:1: **I may tell you what shall happen to you**. Even though Jacob says it is a prophecy, it may seem that his other sons receive no blessing at all. But verse 28 makes it clear that it's also a blessing: a blessing suitable to each.

49:1: **in days to come**. God has revealed to him some events of the future. Or perhaps, words about these events?

49:1: **возвещу вам, что будет с вами**. В боговдохновенной речи Иаков, минуя предстоящую его потомству жизнь в Египте, пророчески рисует картину будущей жизни каждого колена в Ханаане, причем в каждом случае выходит из индивидуальных качеств того или другого сына своего и обстоятельств жизни его, и затем переходит к будущности, то более близкой, то более отдаленной, его поколения. (Лопухин А.П.)

49:1: **в грядущие дни**. В "последние дни" (acharith hajamim)

49:2: **сыны Иакова, послушайте Израиля, отца вашего**. В сем вступлении видно намерение возбудить особенное внимание к следующей речи. Между тем оно также показывает необыкновенное состояние духа, дающее необыкновенный вид и речи. (Свт. Филарет (Дроздов))

49:3: **верх достоинства и верх могущества**. По объяснению Таргумов Онкелоса и Ионафана, Мидрашей и блаженного Иеронима, этим обозначены принадлежавшие Рувиму по праву первородства: 1) двойное наследство; 2) власть священства или достоинств первосвященства; 3) царская власть;
Первое, вместо него, досталось Иосифу, второе — Левию, третье — Иуде.
(Лопухин А.П.)

49:3: **но ты бушевал, как вода**. В еврейском текста: "но ты пролился, как вода". Согрешил словно вода, которая не помещается в маленьком сосуде, пролился в прорыве сладострастия. (Блж. Иероним Стридонский)

49:4: **you shall not have preeminence**. In other words, Jacob is saying that he is deprived of the firstborn rights.

49:4: **you defiled it**. Imagine how it feels like to receive *this* instead of a blessing from a dying father.

49:4: **не будешь преимуществовать**. Иаков показывает, что нет никакой пользы от преимуществ природы, если они не сопровождаются совершенствами воли, так как только качества воли привлекают или похвалу или укоризну.
Ты, говорит, по собственной опрометчивости, потерял достоинство, данное тебе от природы.
(Свт. Иоанн Златоуст)

49:4: **Не будешь преимуществовать**. Колено Рувимово никогда не игравшего сколько-нибудь значительной роли в истории израильского народа. 
Уже Моисей в благословении своем колену Рувимову (Втор. 33:6) молитвенно желает ему лишь того, чтобы оно не вымерло. 
Девора обличает рувимлян в безучастном отношении к общенародному бедствию порабощения и освободительной войне (Суд. 5:15–16). 
В последующее время колено Рувима одно из первых исчезает из истории.
(Лопухин А.П.)

49:5: **Симеон и Левий братья**. То есть не только по рождению, но и по свойствам, по деяниям и частию по судьбе будущей. (Свт. Филарет (Дроздов))

49:5: **орудия жестокости**. Ревность, которую они выказали за сестру свою, увлекла их в несправедливость. (Свт. Иоанн Златоуст)

49:5: **орудия жестокости**. не по справедливости убили они жителей, ибо надлежало умертвить одного Сихема за посрамление сестры их, а не жителей целого города. (Прп. Ефрем Сирин)

49:5: **орудия жестокости**. из колена Симеона были фарисеи, а из колена Левия - первосвященники (по Тертуллиану, Амвросию, и согласно с иудейским преданием -- Свт. Филарет (Дроздов)). Их советом и решением Христос был предан и убит. Эти события в своих словах предвидит пророк. (Сщмч. Ипполит Римский)

49:5: **мечи** (Евр. mecherotheihem). Слово неизвестного значения. Возможно какое-то оружие, но может быть: ухищения, обман, обручение. (Свт. Филарет (Дроздов))

49:5: **violence**. The pronouncement centers on their violent disposition. Jacob distances himself from their fierce anger and cruel wrath. (ESV)

49:6: **в совет их да не внидет душа моя**. Этими словами Иаков показывает, что тогда, во время Сихемских событий, не было его благословения на убийство. Отсюда мы узнаём мнение Иакова. (Блж. Иероним Стридонский)

49:6: **they killed men**. A reference to the massacre at Shechem.

49:7: **I**. God is speaking through Jacob.

49:7: **I will divide them**. Jacob indicates that their descendants will be scattered throughout the other tribes. As a result, their strength will be dissipated, preventing them from bringing destruction on Israel. (ESV)

49:7: **scatter them**. The Levites receive 48 cities distributed throughout all the tribal areas, and the Simeonites obtain land within the territory taken by Judah. These arrangements prevented either tribe from dominating the rest. (ESV)

49:7: **разделю их**. Чтобы не были они сопредельны между собою, дабы вредному единомыслию двух братьев не стали подражать их потомки. (Свт. Филарет (Дроздов))

49:7: **разделю**. Левиты рассеваются для предупреждения вредных между ними союзов; но и благословляются Богом за оказанную неоднократно ревность к вере (Исх. 32:26: "И Моисей .. сказал: кто Господень, - ко мне! И собрались к нему все сыны Левиины"; Чис. 25:10-13: "будет он ему .. заветом священства вечного за то, что он показал ревность по Боге своём"). (Свт. Филарет (Дроздов))

49:7: **прокляи гнев их**. Колено Симеона быстро уменьшилось в числе за 40 лет странствования по пустыне: с 59 300 (Чис. 1:23) до 22 000 (Чис. 26:14). В Ханаане оно получило удел свой не самостоятельно, а в пределах Иудина колена (Нав. 19:1-9). 
Малозначительность его в общенародной жизни видна уже из того, что в благословении Моисея (Втор. 33) оно совсем не упоминается. По иудейскому преданию, наибольшее число бедняков было в колене Симеона.
(Лопухин А.П.)

49:8: **Judah** means "praised". 

49:8: **Judah**. Jacob clearly anticipates that Judah and Joseph will outshine their brothers in importance; together their blessings make up about half of Jacob’s speech. (ESV)

49:8: **Judah** receives a long and positive blessing, permeated with statements that highlight positive qualities of leadership. (ESV)

49:8: **Иуда**. Пророчество об Иуде означает «не вообще будущее, но будущее завершительное, именно мессианское время завершения всего» (Лопухин А.П.)

49:8: **Иуда**.  Благословение, данное Иуде, таинственно: оно предзнаменовало все то, что относится ко Христу. (Свт. Иоанн Златоуст)

49:8: **тебя восхвалят братья твои**. По Мидрашу, это значит, что все колена Израилевы впоследствии будут носить имя Иуды — будут называться иудеями. (Лопухин А.П.)

49:8: **Рука твоя на хребте врагов твоих.**. Твое племя будет побеждать врагов твоего народа; а великий Глава колена твоего и всех колен земных — Лев из племени Иудина победит (Откр. 5:5: "вот, лев от колена Иудина, корень Давидов, победил, и может раскрыть сию книгу и снять семь печатей ее") врагов великой судьбы человеческой. (Свт. Филарет (Дроздов))

49:8: **Поклонятся тебе сыны отца твоего**. Сему великому победителю не только поклонятся естественные твои чада, но и усыновленные по благодати сыны отца твоего, и "всякое колено небесных, земных и преисподних" (Фил. 2:10). (Свт. Филарет (Дроздов))

49:8: **поклонятся тебе**. Если во всей полноте развилось это могущество Иудина колена при Давиде, то уже и в пустыне оно было во главе всех колен (Чис. 2:3), и первое же начало завоевание Ханаана (Суд. 1:1–8). Гербом своим на военном знамени Иудино колено имело изображение льва. (Лопухин А.П.)

49:9: **юный лев**. Иуды, крепостию уподобится юному, возрастающему льву. (Свт. Филарет (Дроздов))

49:9: **преклонился он**. То есть ты уподобляешься льву не разъяренному и терзающему, но насыщенному и спокойному в победоносном величии. (Свт. Филарет (Дроздов))

49:9: **кто пробудит его?**. Львы спят, или лежат с закрытыми глазами, до 20 часов в сутки.

49:10: **until tribute comes**. Or, by a slight emendation: "until he comes to whom it belongs". (ESV)

49:10: **until Shiloh comes**. If this is the correct reading, then  it could be an allusion to the departure of the ark of the covenant from Shiloh in the time of Samuel, when the tribe of Judah, in the person of David, replaced the tribe of Ephraim as Israel’s leading tribe. Associated with the future Judahite king is a time of prolific grape harvest (Gen. 49:11). The picture presented here accords with later statements that link the Davidic dynasty with agricultural prosperity (e.g., Ps. 72:16; Amos 9:11–15). (ESV)

49:10: **the obedience of the peoples**. This is the chief aspect of messianic expectations in the OT: the way that Abraham’s blessing will come to the Gentiles will be by the ultimate heir of David reigning and incorporating the Gentiles into his benevolent empire. This explains why the installation of Jesus as the Davidic king is so important in the NT, with the implication that the long-awaited time of enlightening the Gentiles has finally arrived. (ESV)

49:10: **не отойдёт скипетр .. и законодатель .. доколе**. Колену Иудиному обещается верховная власть: правительственная, и законодательная. Затем указывается предел этого господства. (Лопухин А.П.)

49:10: **доколе не приидет Примиритель**. Весьма неодинаково понимается толкователями из-за слова Schiloh. 
1. Мессианское. Толкование господствовало в иудейской синагоге и в христианской церкви, как древней, так и новой. Понимают Schiloh как "примиритель", "князь мира". В Талмуде и Мидрашах Шило — одно из имен Мессии. 
2. «пока не придут в Силом»: Имя города Силом Ефремова колена, где по завоевании Ханаана поставлена была скиния. Но тогда смысл очень ограничительный: гегемония Иуды была бы очень кратковременна, да и приход в Силом не составляет никакой эпохи.
(Лопухин А.П.)

49:10: **Ему покорность народов**. «Это самый ясный признак пришествия Господа» (блаженный Феодорит)

49:10: **не оскудеет .. доколе не придёт Примиритель**. По пришествии Мессии скипетр и законоположники от Иуды отнимутся и царство Иудино заменено будет царством покорных Мессии народов.
Событие сих предсказаний достигло своего предела, когда Иудея, потеряв своих царей, превращена в Римскую область и потом Иерусалим, глава Иуды, разрушен; и сие ныне служит непререкаемым свидетельством против Иудеев, что Мессия уже пришел.
(Свт. Филарет (Дроздов))

49:10: **не отойдёт скипетр от Иуды .. доколе не придёт Примиритель**. известно, что вплоть до рождества Христова не оскудевали князья из рода Иуды и вожди от чресел его, вплоть до царя Ирода, который, если верить истории, которую написал Иосиф [Флавий], был чужеземцем и благодаря интригам добился царствования в Иудее. Сразу, как только это случилось и не стало вождя от чресел Иуды, приходит Тот, Кому это Царствие было предназначено, Кого ожидают народы и о Ком учит евангельская вера и церковная проповедь. (Руфин)

49:11: **Виноградная лоза, ослёнок, вино, молоко**.  Ст. 11–12 рисуют картину богатства территории колена Иудина произведениями земледелия и скотоводства: чрезвычайное обилие винограда, стад, и молока. (Лопухин А.П.)

49:11: **Он привязывает к виноградной лозе ослёнка**. Иаков предвещает ему обитание на земле, столь обильной виноградом и млеком, что к виноградной лозе и даже к лозе превосходного винограда (שרק значит виноград, имеющий ягоды без костей) он будет привязывать ослов, не жалея повредить лозу или плод (Свт. Филарет (Дроздов))

49:11: **Он привязывает к виноградной лозе осленка**. Так как осел считался нечистым животным, то Иаков и говорит, что эти нечистые языческие народы Он приведет с такою же легкостию, как если бы кто-нибудь привязал осленка к виноградной ветви. Христос сам уподолял Своё учение виноградной лозе. (Свт. Иоанн Златоуст)

49:11: **моет в вине одежду свою и в крови гроздов одеяние свое**. Под одеждою, я думаю, разумеется тело, которое для совершения спасения удостоил носить (Христос). Потом, чтобы в точности показать, что он назвал «вином», Иаков присовокупляет: «и в крови гроздия одеяние свое». Смотри, как он наименованием крови означил заклание, и крест, и все строение таин. (Свт. Иоанн Златоуст)
