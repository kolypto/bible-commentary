## Matthew




















### Introduction




















#### Introduction

The central personality of OT prophecy is the coming great King Who will rule in God's promised kingdom: a righteous king, both *human* (born of a virgin, Is 7:14; afflicted, Is 53:3-7; Son of Man, Dan 7:13) and *divine* (Mighty God, Eternal Father, Is 9:6-7; Immanuel, Is 7:14; The Lord, Zeph 3:15; The Lord of Hosts, Zech 14:17). (MacArthur)




















#### Authorship

Matthew was a tax collector (Mt 9:9): a hated and ostracized traitor of the Jewish society. Matthew is modest in writing his account: he always refers to himself in the 3rd person and nowhere speaks of himself as the author. We know of his authorship because his name is attached to all early copies of the manuscripts and because the early church Fathers unanimously attest him to be the book's author. (MacArthur)




















#### Message

The message is the theme of Jesus' kingship: a King who is revealed, rejected, and a King who will return. Jesus is painted in royal colors as in no other gospel. Yet Matthew also focuses most uniquely on the rejection of Jesus as King: in no other gospel are the attacks against Him so bitter and vile. (MacArthur)




















### Chapter 1

1:1: The genealogy: Gk. *genesis*.

1:1: The NT opens appropriately with the four gospels: the basis of all apostolic preaching (Expositor's).

1:1: Consistent with the purpose of revealing **Jesus** as King, Matthew begins with proving that He comes from the recognized royal family. As promised through Samuel (2 Sam 7:12-16), it would be through **David**'s descendant that will establish God's eternal kingdom over Israel. (MacArthur)

1:1: The Jews' concern for pedigrees existed for a long time. In Num 26,34,35 tribes were allocated lands. In Ezra 2:61-62, certain "sons of the priests" were not allowed to serve because "their ancestral registration ... could not be located. '' In Luke 2:4, Joseph had to register in his hometown. We learn from Josephus that in the NT times many Jewish families maintained detailed and highly valued ancestral files. It is both interesting and significant that since the destruction of the Temple in A.D. 70 no genealogies exist that can trace the ancestry of any Jew now living; for those Jews who still look for the Messiah, his lineage to David could never be established. (MacArthur)

1:1-2: Jews of that time were already expected the Messiah (the **Christ**, Gk. *Christos*, Heb. *mashiah*,  the anointed one; like a king) to come and save their people (**Jesus**, or Yeshua, means "Yahweh saves"). In order for the prophecy to be fulfilled, this Christ had to be from a certain lineage: tribe of **Judah**, son of **David**, Who would inherit his throne.

1:6: Genealogies need include only men; the unexpected appearance of four women draws attention to them. All four women are of gentile origin. (IVP)

1:3-6: Matthew also shows us the work of God's grace in His choosing four former outcasts. **Tamar** (v. 3): the Canaanine daughter-in-law of Judah who committed prostitution and incest (Gen 38). **Rahab** (v. 5): a Gentile prostitute who lied to king's messengers (Josh 2:1-21; 6:22-25). **Ruth** (v. 5), a Moabite, who were descendants of Lot's inscestous union with his daugher. Mahlon, who married Ruth, did so in violation of the Mosaic Law (Dt 7:3), and she had no right to marry an Israelite. Many Jewish writers say his early death, and that of his brother, were a divine judgment on their disobedience. Bathsheba, the **wife of Uriah** (v. 6), had borne a son produced by the adultery, but he died in infancy. The next sone born to them was **Solomon**. (MacArthur)

1:6: Matthew follows the royal line through David and Solomon, David's son and successor to the throne. Luke follows the royal line through Nathan, another son of David. (MacArthur).

1:12: It is striking how many ungodly, wicked people are in Jesus' lineage: and almost half of those kings "did evil in the eyes of the Lord". **Jeconiah** was so wicked that God cursed his entire line: see Jer 22:24,30. This genealogy is a beautiful testimony to God's grace.

1:12: The miracle of virgin birth protected Jesus from regal disqualification because of Joseph's being a descendant of **Jeconiah**. Because of his wickedness, God had declared that no man of his descendants  will sit on the throne of David (Jer 22:30). That curse does not preclude Jesus' right to kingship because He is not a natural son of Joseph, who was in Jeconiah's line. Jesus' legal descent from David came through Jeconiah to Joseph, but His blood descent, and *His human right to rule*, came through Mary, who was not in Jeconiah's lineage. Thus the curse on Jeconiah's offspring was circumvented. (MacArthur)

1:16: Matthew's intent is to validate Jesus' royal claim by showing His *legal descent* from David through Joseph, who was Jesus' legal, though not natural, father. While Luke's intent is to trace Jesus' actual royal blood ancestry through His mother, thereby establishing his racial lineage from David, and from Adam. (MacArthur)

1:16: До сих пор про каждого мужчину было сказано "родил": "Авраам родил Исаака". Родила его, конечно, Сара, но зародил его Авраам, потому и написано: "Авраам родил". И так продолжается по всей линии, вплоть до Иосифа. А про Иосифа не сказано, что он "родил", потому что не от него был зачат Иисус, а от Духа Святого. (Проповедь)

1:17: From Matthew's summary we see God's grace at work in 3 periods. **From Abraham to David** it was a period of wandering, of enslavement in a foreign land, or deliverance, of covenant-making, of conquest and victory. **From David to the deportation to Babylon** it was a period of almost uninterrupted decline, degeneracy, apostasy and tragedy. There was defeat, conquest, exile, and the destruction of Jerusalem and its temple. **From the deportation to Babylon to the time of Christ** was Israel's Dark Age: a period of captivity, exile, frustration and of marking time. (MacArthur)

1:18: **Birth** (Gk. *genesis*) is from the same Greek root as "genealogy" in v. 1, indicating that Matthew is here giving a parallel account on Jesus' ancestry: this time, from His Father's side. vv. 1-17 established Jesus' human origin; the following verses show HIs divine origin. (MacArthur)

1:18: The incarnation of **Jesus Christ** is the central fact of Christianity. The whole superstructure of Christian theology is built on it. The essence and the power of the gospel is that God became man and that, by being both wholly God and wholly man, He was able to reconcile men to God. Apart from Jesus' being both human and divine, there is no gospel. Were He no more than just a human prophet, He could not have conquered sin or death or satan; He could not have saved the world. It is surely no accident, therefore, that the beginning of the gospel is devoted to establishing both the regal humanity and the deity of Jesus Christ. (MacArthur) 

1:18: Some argued that the men who wrote the NT could have simply picked up on the many virgin **birth** legends that were common in the ancient world. But the immoral and repulsive character of those stories cannot be compared to the gospel accounts: such stories are satan's vile counterfeits of God's pure truth. (MacArthur)

1:18: It is possible that both Joseph and Mary were quite young when they were **betrothed**. Girls were often betrothed as young as 12 or 13, and boys when they were several years older than that. The marriage was almost always arranged by the families of the bride and groom, often without consulting them. A betrothal was more than an engagement in the modern sense: the contract was considered binding as soon as it was made, and the man and woman were considered legally married, even though the marriage and consummation often did not occur until as much as a year later. The betrothal period served as a time of probation and testing of fidelity, when the bride and groom usually had little, if any, social contact with each other. (MacArthur)

1:18: The virgin birth should not have surprised those Jews who knew and believed the OT. Because of a misinterpretation of the phrase "A woman encircles a man" in jer 31:22, many rabbis believed the Messiah would have an unusual birth. They said, "Messiah is to have no earthly father". (MacArthur)

1:18: A skeptic who denied the virgin birth once asked a Christian: "If I told you that child over there was born without a human father, would you believe me?" The believer replied: "Yes, if he lived as Jesus lived". The greatest outward evidence of Jesus' supernatural birth and deity is His life. (MacArthur)

1:19: According to the Law, a woman who committed adultery could be stoned (Dt 22:23-24). It would've been a great **shame** for her anyway. Wounded though he felt, Joseph decided to **divorce her quietly** for her sake: i.e. not bringing unnecessary shame on her. He had no option of giving her a second chance, even if he wanted to (IVP).

1:19: **Joseph** had a double problem. Because of his **righteous** moral standards, Joseph knew that he should not go through with the marriage because of Mary's pregnancy, justly assuming that she had had relations with another man. But also, because of his righteous love and kindness, he could not bear the thought of shaming her publicly (a common practice of his day in regard to such an offense), much less demanding her death, as provided by the law (Dt 22:23-24). His concern was not for his own shame but for Mary's. (MacArthur)

1:20: Jesus' **conception by the Holy Spirit** is a great mystery. We could no more fathom such a thing than we can fathom the blending of the divine and human, like God's creating the universe from nothing, His being one God in three persons, or His giving an entirely new spiritual nature to those who trust in His Son.  

1:21: The significance of this name is clear: "**Jesus**" is a form of the Hebrew Joshua, Jeshua, Jehoshua, the basic meaning of which is "Yahweh will save". By His own work He would save His people from their sins. (MacArthur)

1:21: **Save His people from their sins**. Christianity in short: God saves men from sin. This is basically what the whole message is about, and these verses summarize Christianity. (MacArthur)

1:22: This phrase gives a simple, straightforward definition of biblical inspiration as the Word of the Lord coming through human instruments. God does the saying. (MacArthur)

1:23: Matthew did not give the term *alma* a Christian "twist", but used it with the same meaning with which all Jews of that time used it. See Is 7:14 and note. (MacArthur)

1:23: One title represents His office; the other — His nature. Understanding of such things will have to await heaven when we will "know fully" (1 Cor 13:12). (MacArthur)

1:24: When God reveals the truth to Joseph, he immediately believes and obeys God's will, unbelievable as the truth would seem. Joseph would remain an object of shame because he got his wife pregnant before the wedding. He chose to embrace shame (IVP).

1:24: We can imagine how great his feelings of amazement, relief, and gratitude must have been. Not only would he be able to take his beloved Mary as his wife with honor and righteousness, but he would be ien care of God's own Son while He was growing up. (MacArthur)

1:25: The implication here is that normal marital relations began after that time. The fact that Jesus' brothers and sisters are spoken of numerous times in the gospels (Mt 12:46: "his mother and his brothers stood outside"; Mt 13:55-56 and Mk 6:3: "And are not his brothers James and Joseph and Simon and Judas? And are not all his sisters with us?"; Jn 7:5: "For not even his brothers believed in him."; etc) prove that Mary did not remain a virgin perpetually, as some claim. (MacArthur)




















### Chapter 2

2:1: Matthew continues to establish **Jesus**' kingship. The homage of the **magi**: powerful oriental kingmakers from Persia who traveled a great distance to recognize and honor a King. And a negative testimony of Herod's hatred to a child. (MacArthur) 

2:1: **Magi**: priestly astrologers. They brought three gifts, which led to conclusions about their number; the Bible does not really specify their number.

2:1: Few biblical stories are as well known, yet so clouded by myth and tradition, as that of the **magi**. During the Middle Ages legend developed that they were kings, 3 in number, and that their names were Casper, Balthazar, and Melchior. Because they were though to represent the three sons of Noah, one of them is often pictured as an Ethiopian (black). A XII century bishop of Cologne even claimed to have found their skulls. (MacArthur)

2:1: The **magi** (Gk. *magoi*) were primarily known as the priestly-political class of the Parthians, who lived to the east of Palestine. They first appear in history in 7 B.C. as a tribe within the Median nation. Shemites. Soon came to be associated solely with the hereditary priesthood within that tribe. The magi became skilled in astronomy and astrology (which, in that day, were closely associated) and had a sacrificial system that somewhat resembled the one in the OT. They were involved in various occult practices, including sorcery, and were especially noted for their ability to interpret dreams. It is from their name that our words "magic" and "magician" are derived. 
A principle element of magian worship was fire: on their primary altar burned a perpetual flame, which they claimed descended from heaven. The magi were monotheistic, believing in the existence of only one god. Because of their monotheism, it was easy for them to adapt to the teaching of Zoroaster, who believed in the single god. 
Because of their combined knowledge of science, agriculture, mathematics, history, and the occult, their religious and political influence continued to grow until they became the most prominent and powerful group of advisors in the Medo-Persian empire. It was not strange, therefore, that they often were referred to a "wise men". Historians tell us that no Persian was ever able to become king without mastering the scientific and religious disciplines of the magi and then beging approved and crowned by them. 
From Daniel, we learn that they were among the highest-ranking officials in Babylon, when he was assigned a chief over them (Dan 2:24,48). It was a chief of the Babylonian magi that was with Nebuchadnezzar when he attacked and conquered Judah (Jer 39:3).
The **magic from the east** (Gk. anatolon, from anatello; literally: a rising of light, i.e. Dawn; by implication, east) were of a completely different sort. They surely had been strongly influenced by Judaism, probably God-fearing Gentiles. Despite their paganism, quasi-science, and superstition, they recognized God's voice when He spoke. They immediately recognized God's light when it shone on them. They had genuinely seeking hearts, hearts that the Lord promises will never fail to find Him (Jer 29:13).
(MacArthur) 

2:2: **saying** in its Greek form suggests that they went around the city questioning whomever they met. Because they, as foreigners, knew of the monumental birth, they apparently assumed that anyone in Judea would know of this special baby's whereabouts. They must have been more than a little shocked to discover that no one seemed to know what they were talking about.
During that time there was widespread expectation of the coming of a great king, a great deliverer. The Roman historian Suetonius, speaking of the time around the birth of Christ, wrote, "There had spread over all the Orient an old and established belief that it was fated at that time for men coming from Judea to rule the world." Another Roman historian, Tacitus, wrote that "there was a firm persuasion that at this very time the east was to grow powerful and rulers coming from Judea were to acquire a universal empire". The Jewish historian Josephus reports that at about the time of Christ's birth the Jews believed that one from their country would soon become ruler of the habitable earth.
(MacArthur)

2:2: These wise men came from the rising of the light (east in v. 1, Gk. "rising of the light"), following a light (a **star**). That is, from light to light.

2:2: Both the Hebrew and the Greek words for **star** (Gk. aster) were also used figuratively to represent any great brilliance or radiance. 

2:2: The guidance of the **star** was not very precise, for they had to ask around. Later, the star pinpointed the location. It is also possible that it disappeared, reappearing only after the magi were told of the prophesied birthplace of the Messiah (vv. 5–6).

2:3: **Herod** was now some 70 years old. (MacArthur)

2:3: **Herod** reigned over Palestine from 37BC to 4BC. He was known for killing his potential rivals. He surely wanted to kill this "king of the Jews" as well (John Strohman)

2:3: **Herod** was an Edomite, not a Jew, and had no legitimate claim to be the Jew's king. He was a ururper to the throne on which he say only by virtue of Rome, who herself ruled Judah only by the "right" of military force. Herod therefore feared and hated even the suggestion of a rival claimant. (MacArthur)

2:3: **Herod** the Great (one of the several Herods in the NT) was a clever and capable warrior, orator, and diplomat. In 40 B.C. he was appointed by Rome to be king of the Jews. He invaded Palestine the next year and, after several years of fighting, drove out the Parthians and established his kingdom. 
Being an Edomite, he married Mariamne, heiress to the Jewish Hasmonean house, in order to make himself more acceptable to the Jews he now ruled. 
In times of severe economic hardship, **Herod** gave back some tax money collected from the people. During the great famine of 25 B.C., he melted down various gold objects in the palace to buy food for the poor. He built many entertainment places. He revived Samaria, embellished several cities. He built the remarkable and almost impregnable fortress of Masada, and in 19 B.C. he began the reconstruction of the Temple in Jerusalem. 
But **Herod** was also cruel and merciless. He was incredibly jealous, suspicious, and afraid for his position and power. Fearing his potential thread, he had the high priest Aristobulus (Mariamne's brother) drowned, after which he provided a magnificent funeral where he pretended to weep. He then had Mariamne herself killed, and then her mother and two of his own sons. Five days before his death (about a year after Jesus was born) he had his third son executed. Because he knew no one would mourn him, he has arrested the most distinguished citizens of Jerusalem and gave orders for those prisoners to be executed the moment he died — in order to guarantee that there would be mourning in Jerusalem; but it was not carried out. (MacArthur). 
**Herod** died in Jericho, after an excruciatingly painful, putrefying illness of uncertain cause, known to posterity as "Herod's Evil". Josephus states that the pain of his illness led Herod to attempt suicide by stabbing. (Wikipedia) 
Josephus reports that Herod "died of this, ulcerated entrails, putrified and maggot-filled organs, constant convulsions, foul breath, and neither physicians nor warm baths led to recovery". (MacArthur)
Josephus also lists several major features of the disease that caused his death - among them, intense itching, painful intestinal problems, breathlessness, convulsions in every limb, and gangrene of the genitalia. (Internet)

2:3: The response of **Herod** was exactly the opposite of that of the magi: they rejoiced, but he **was troubled**. Even after driving out the Parthians, he had to continue fighting the bands of Jewish zealots who wanted the freedom of their country. Any mention of another king of the Jews sent him into a frenzy of paranoid fear and anger. Because the magi themselves were probably Parthians, and because of their wealth, prestige, and power, their appearance from the east portended a renewed political thread from the east.
That **all Jesusalem with him** was also troubled may indicate that they too viewed the magi as the precursors of another conquest by the Parthians, who had sent this forward body ahead to discover and perhaps even crown some new king that would rule Palestine in Parthia's behalf. Since the magi had long been known as much for their politics as for their religion, their worship would not have been seen as purely religious.
It is more likely that the public concern was actually about Herod's reaction to the appearance of the magi: by bitter experience they knew that Herod's agitation usually meant maniacal bloodsched: he did not bother to identify his enemies carefully, and anyone even suspected of plotting against him was in considerable danger. The people's fear for their own safety was well founded. In v. 16, we will see how his anger is vented against Bethlehem.
(MacArthur)

2:4: By NT times, the high** priests** had become little more than a group of corrupt, religiously oriented politicians, subject to favoritism and even purchase. High priests were appointed and removed at the whim of various rulers. The ones who had been removed usually kept the title, as well as considerable prestige and power (Lk 3:2: "during the high priesthood of Ananias and Caiaphas", mentions two high priests). (MacArthur)

2:4: The **scribes**, mostly Pharisees, often referred to as lawyers, were authorities on Jewish law, scriptural and traditional; the key scholars of religious Judaism. They were conservative theologically, held a literalistic view of Scripture, and were generally legalistic and strict in regard to both ceremonial and moral law. Those of the Scribes who were Sadducees were liberal.

2:4: Herod took the matter seriously and **assembled** **the chief priests** in order to help the magi find the Christ. The magi did not depart, but awaited for Herod's priests to consult the priests. In v. 8, Herod sends the magi to Bethlehem, according to the direction given to him by the priests.

2:4: **Herod** called all of them together, constantly asking (the imperfect tense of **inquire**). (MacArthur)

2:4: Obviously Herod connected the King of the Jews with the Messiah, the **Christ**, for he knew Jewish beliefs and customs rather well. (MacArthur)

2:4: Contrary to what many, perhaps most, unbelieving Jews today think, those ancient teachers of Israel knew that the coming Messiah, **the Christ**, would be more than a godly attitude or the personified perfection of the Jewish Kingdom. The Messiah would be a real man born among men, sent to rule men. The ones that had more than enough knowledge to recognize HIm when He came and to know that they, like the magi, should worship Him, did not believe, and became His supreme enemies. (MacArthur)

2:4: Wee see the three typical responses to Jesus Christ here. Some, like Herod, are immediately hateful. Others, like the priests, pay little attention to God and His way: they do not accept of obey what they know of God; eventually, of course, this second group inevitably joins the first, because indifference to God is simply hatred that is concealed and rejection that is delayed. Others, however, like the magi, accept the Lord when He comes to them. They may have little of His light initially, but because they know it is *His* light, they believe, obey, and worship. (MacArthur)

2:6: **Bethlehem** was a small town. It used to be called "Ephrath" or "Ephrathah", but its new name (given by Joshua) means "house of bread". Here Jacob buried Rachel (Gen 35:19). Here Ruth met and married Boaz (Ruth 1:22, 2:4). Here, David grew up and tended sheep (1 Sam 17:12,15). By the time of Jesus' birth, it had long been called "the city of David" (Lk 2:4,11). The prophet Micah specifically promised that the Messiah would come from this small village (Mic 5:2). (MacArthur)

2:6: **shepherd**ing is typically understood as "tender care" by the people, but scriptural view is a strong, even stern, leader, a **Ruler**. It becomes clear that a sovereign dominance is meant in in the book of Revelation: "with a rod of iron" (Rev 12:5). (MacArthur)

2:7: It was already enough for **Herod** to know that the sign pointed to the birth of someone who could be a threat to his own power and position. He hypocritically gave the magi a good-sounding reason for wanting to know the exact location and identity of the Child, but his ultimate purpose was made clear by what he actually did. (MacArthur)

2:7: Herod asked **secretly** probably because he did not want anyone to hear his words about worshipping.

2:10: The magi were overwhelmed that the special star that went missing has reappeared to them. Matthew piles up superlatives to emphasize the extent of exhilaration they felt, thus indicating their uniquely strong interest in this great event. (MacArthur)

2:11: The events described in this passage probably occurred several months after Jesus was born. **Mary** would have completed her period of purification (Lk 2:21-22) of seven days. Jesus, therefore, would already have been circumcised on the eighth day. The fact that Mary offered "a pair of two turtledoves" (Lk 2:24) instead of the normal lamb (Lev 12:6-8) indicates that the family was poor. Had this offering been made after the magi with their expensive **gifts** had already visited Jesus, the lamb could easily have been afforded and would have been required. (MacArthur)

2:11: The magi came into the **house** (not the stable) and seen the **child** (not a baby). This means that several months, perhaps even a year, have passed already. Another indirect evidence is that Herod would order to kill all children *under two years old* (v. 16): the age range he had expected Jesus to fall into. A broad range may signify that Jesus was already a year old. Or it may not.

2:11: **house** (Gk. *oikian*) — properly, residence, but usually an abode. **Child** (Gk. *paidion*) — a childling, i.e., an infant, or a half-grown boy or girl. (Strong's Dictionary)

2:11: All the magi seen was a helpless **Child** with His **mother**. They believed having seen no miracles performed by Him. (John Strohman)

2:11: Matthew is careful to say that the magi **worshipped Him**, that is, the Child, not his **mother**. They knew better than Cornelius, who attempted to worship the apostle Peter (Ac 10:25). It was also to **Him** that they **offered gifts**: an expression of worship. (MacArthur)

2:11: **Gold**: the most precious of metals, the universal symbol of material value and wealth. Also a symbol of nobility and royalty. **Frankincense**: a costly, beautiful-smelling incense that was used only for the most special of occasions, as well as temple worship. **Myrrh**: a valuable perfume, also used as anesthetic. Mixed with other spices, it was used in preparation of bodies for burial
Some interpreters suggest that **gold** was a gift for His royalty; **frankincense** — for His deity (incense of deity, used in the Temple), and **myrrh** for His mortal humanity. (MacArthur)

2:12: The **warn**ing by God suggests direct communication, and that their role in the whole event was by divine design. (MacArthur)

2:13: God has chosen to protect the family not by miraculously hiding or defending them, but by the very ordinary means of flight to a foreign country. The primary reason is told in v.15: to fulfil a prophecy. (MacArthur)

2:13: **Egypt** was a natural asylum. Alexander the great established a sanctuary for Jews in Alexandria (the Egyptian city he named for himself), and the city was still considered a special place of safety and opportunity for Jews. Philo, himself a prominent resident of Alexandria, reported in 40 A.D. that the population included at least one million Jews. In the 3-rd century B.C. a group of Jewish scholars in Alexandria had produced the Septuagint. (MacArthur)

2:14: We do not know what was done with the gifts (v. 11), but it seems reasonable that they were used to finance the trip to **Egypt** and to help support the family while there. (MacArthur)

2:15: The OT writers were the Lord's spokesmen. Herod's threat was no surprise to the Lord, who, long before Herod was born, had made plans to foil that wicked king's plans against the true King. In Hos 11:1, the reference to "**my son**" is to the nation Israel. Matthew shows that Jesus' return from Egypt was *pictured* by Israel's calling from that same country many centuries earlier. The Exodus, therefore, was a type of Jesus' return from Egypt. As God had once brought the people of Israel out of Egypt to be His chosen nation, He now had brought out His greater Son to be the Messiah.
A *type* is a nonverbal prediction: an OT person or event that illustrates some aspect of the person and work of the Lord Jesus Christ in the future but does not specifically describe it. 
Because types are veiled revelation, divine testimony to their identity must be given by the Holy Spirit in the NT text; we can only safely refer to something as a "type" only if NT identifies it. Ignoring such limits results in the freedom to allegorize, spiritualize, and typify the OT by whimsy. (MacArthur)

2:16: The work "**tricked**" (or even, "mocked" KJV) refers to **Herod**'s perception of the motives of the **magi**, not their true intention. It was not their purpose to trick or make sport of the king but simply to obey God's command. (MacArthur)

2:16: Those innocent and precious babies of **Bethlehem** were the first casualties in the now-intensified warfare between the kingdoms of this world and the kingdom of God's Christ. (MacArthur)

2:17: The term "**fulfilled**" (from pleroo, "to fill up") marks this our as completing an OT prediction. This prophecy was also in the form of a *type*: a non-verbal prediction. 

2:18: It's not that Matthew has found some random weeping woman in the OT to use in his text. It was at Bethlehem that Jacob buried **Rachel** (Gen 35:19), the traditional site of whose tomb is still shown to tourists today. (MacArthur)

2:18: Jeremiah 31:15 was speaking of the great sorrow that would soon be experienced in Israel when most of her people would be carried captive to Babylon. **Ramah** (five miles North of Jerusalem) was a place where Jewish captives were assembled for deportation to Babylon (Jer 40:1). **Rachel**, the mother of Ephraim (often used in the OT as a synonym for the northern kingdom) and Benjamin (whose tribe became part of the southern kingdom) represented the lamentation of all Jewish mothers over Israel's great tragedy. They also typified and prefigured the monthers of Bethlehem weeping bitterly over the massacre of their children. (MacArthur)

2:19: Josephus reports that **Herod** "**died** of this, ulcerated entrails, putrified and maggot-filled organs, constant convulsions, foul breath, and neither physicians nor warm baths led to recovery". (MacArthur)

2:20: The fact that the angel spoke of **those who sought the Child's life** indicates that Herod was not alone in his plans to destroy his supposed rival; but like Herod, the other conspirators were themselves now **dead**. (MacArthur)

2:22: **Archelaus** posed another, more general threat. Before his death, **Herod** had executed two popular Jewish rabbis, Judas and Matthias, who had stirred up their disciples and other faithful Jews in Jerusalem to tear down the offensive Roman eagle that the king had arrogantly erected over the Temple gate. The following Passover, an insurrection broke out, and Archelaus, reflecting his father's senseless cruelty, executed 3000 Jews, many of whom were Passover pilgrims who had no part in the revolt. Any Jew, therefore, who lived in the territory of Archelaus, was in danger. (MacArthur)

2:23: They came and resided in **Nazareth** not only because Joseph and Mary were originally from there (Lk 2:4-5), but also by divine providence, that a prophecy **might be fulfilled**.
The specific statement, "**would be called a Nazarene**", does not appear in the OT. Because Matthew speak of "**the prophets**", plural, it seems that several prophets had made this prediction, though it has not been recorded in the OT. Matthew's original readers were largely Jewish, and this prophecy probably was common knowledge among them. For later readers, the Holy Spirit obviously felt it was enough that we simply know that the prediction was made and that it was fulfilled as Matthew explains. (MacArthur)

2:23: The town of **Nazareth** was inhabited largely by people noted for their crude and violent ways. The term "**Nazarene**" ahd long been a term of derision, used to describe any person who was rough and rude. (The reason behind Nathanael's surprise in Jn 1:46, "can any good thing come our of Nazareth?". He was shocked that the Messiah actually could come from such a disreputable place). 
The early Jewish persecutors of the church apparently considered Jesus' being from Nazareth as evidence that He could *not* be the Messian, rather than, as Matthew tells us, a sign that He was. Tertullus spoke of Paul as "a real pest... and a ringleader of the sect of the Nazarenes" (Ac 24:5). The church Father Jerome wrote that in synagogue prayers Christians were often cursed as Nazarenes. Jesus' birthplace gave Him a name, Jesus the Nazarene, that would be used as a title of reproach, thus fulfilling many other prophecies that depict the Messiah as "despised and forsaken of men" (Is 53:3). (MacArthur)




















### Chapter 3

3:1: Nearly 30 years had elapsed between chapters 2 and 3. (MacArthur)

3:1: "**John**" means "Yahweh is gracious". (MacArthur)

3:1: In the world, greatness is normally measured by fame and wealth. Although **John** comes from a priestly family, there were many such descendants of Aaron, so they had no special dignity of recognition. When John went to live in the **wilderness** (when he was young; see Lk 1:80: "he lived in the deserts"), he forsook even what little social and economic status he had, existing much like a hermit.  He forsook his earthly father's ministry for the sake of his heavenly Father's.
Yet Luke recorded of him, "for he will be great in the sight of the Lord" (Lk 1:15). That man was a sovereignly designed and chosen herald for the great King. His greatness was related to his calling: a herald of the Messiah, the One who was greater still.
**John** knew of his position and task. As a child John no doubt had been told many times of the angel's announcement of his birth and purpose, a purpose from which he never wavered, compromised, or tried to gain personal recognition or advantage.
(MacArthur)

3:1: "**Came**" (Gk. *paraginomai*, to approach, to appear publicly) was often used to indicate an official arrival, such as that of the magi in Mt 2:1. The primary meaning of "**preaching**" (Gk. *kerusso*) is "to herald": used of the official whose duty it was to proclaim loudly and extensively the coming of the king. After spending most of his life in the **desert**, at the right moment God spoke to his heart, and he began to thunder out the message God had given him in that desert. (MacArthur)

3:2: “John baptized with the baptism of repentance, telling the people to believe in the one who was to come after him, that is, Jesus.” (Paul, Acts 19:4)

3:2: John's message could easily be summarized in one word: **repent** (Gk. *metanoeo*). This word means more than regret or sorrow (cf. Heb 12:17, where repentance can be sought with tears, but nevertheless, not found); it means to turn around, to change direction, to change the mind and will. It denotes a change from wrong to right, away from sin and to righteousness. It involves sorrow "that produces a repentance ... leading to salvation" (2 Cor 7:10). Therefore, John's "**repent**" can be rendered "be converted". (MacArthur)

3:2: Baptism is more than just a ritual; one has to **repent**, i.e. make the decision to turn around completely and abandon the life of sin. It is not just feeling sorry, or changing one's mind, but a complete alteration of the basic motivation and direction of one's life (John Strohman). In vv.7-8 John speaks to those who, being religious, did not truly repent, calling them “brood of vipers”. Another emphasis on repentance is in v.11.

3:2: Jesus has began His preaching with exactly the same message (Mk 1:15: "**repent** and believe in the gospel"; Mt 4:17: "**repent**, for the Kingdom of Heaven is at hand"; Lk 5:32: "I have not come to call the righteous but sinners to **repentance**"). The apostles began their preaching with the same message (Mk 6:12: "So they went out and proclaimed that people should **repent**"). In his Pentecost sermon, Peter's concluding words were, "**Repent** and be baptized every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ for the forgiveness of your sins" (Ac 2:38). That's also what Paul declared throughout the whole world (Ac 26:20: "they should **repent** and turn to God, performing deeds in keeping with their **repentance**").  (MacArthur)

3:2: The *message* was "**repent**"; the *motive* was **the kingdom of heaven is at hand**. The people should repent and be converted because the King was coming. (MacArthur) 

3:2: Много раз слышал выражение "**Царствие Небесное**", но был очень удивлён когда наконец начал понимать что это значит. Само слово "царствие" — это когда есть царь, и он правит; а "небесное" говорит о том, Кто этот Царь есть: Господь Бог. Итак, "Царствие Небесное" — это когда Бог правит жизнями людей, и когда для людей Бог авторитет и они слушаются Его. Как говорит Алла, признавать, что Он знает лучше. (Марк)

3:2: The **Kingdom of Heaven** may be thought of having 4 phases.
1. The *prophesied* kingdom: as foretold by Daniel. 2. The *present* kingdom, the one that existed at the time of John and the one that was "**at hand**". 3. An *interim* kingdom: that resulted because of Israel's rejection. The King returned to heaven and His kingdom on earth now exists only in a mystery form. God does not presently exercise His full divine will over the earth, being, so to speak, in a voluntary exile in heaven, and He reigns only in the hearts of those who know Him. 4. The *manifest* kingdom, the Millenium, in which Christ will rule directly, both internally (in the hearts) and externally (over all mankind). 5. The *eternal* kingdom.
Had Israel accepted their King, there would be no interim kingdom. The **kingdom at hand** would have become the kingdom of a thousand years. But because they killed the King, the millennial kingdom was sovereignly postponed. (MacArthur)

3:3: In ancient times it was common for a herald to precede the arrival of the monarch, to announce his coming and to **prepare** for his safe and proper travel. They would make sure that the roadway was as smooth and uncluttered as possible: holes would be filled, rocks and debris would be removed, and unsightly litter would be burned or hidden. The twofold duty was to proclaim and to **prepare**. This is what John's ministry did for God's great King. (MacArthur)

3:3: As herald of the great King, John sought to clear men's hearts of the obstacles that kept them from the King. The **way of the Lord** is the way of repentance, of turning from sin to righteousness, of turning moral and spiritual **paths** that are crooked into ones that are **straight**. (MacArthur)

3:3: **Isaiah** goes on to say: "Every valley shall be lifted up, and every mountain and hill be made low; the uneven ground shall become level, and the rough places a plain. And the glory of the Lord shall be revealed, and all flesh shall see it together" (Is 40:4-5)

3:4: The coming of a worldly king is proclaimed and prepared for with great expense, pomp, and fanfare. Even the announcer dresses in the best suits, stays in the best hotels, contacts only the best people, and makes preparations for the monarch to visit only the best places. But that was not God's plan for the heralding of His Son. John the Baptist was born of obscure parents, dressed strangely even for his day, and carried out his ministry mostly in out-of-the-way and unattractive places. (MacArthur)

3:4: Neither **John**'s food nor clothes were like those of the Pharisees and Scribes, who dressed and ate luxuriously. John's plain food and clothes can be seen as a rebuke to the hypocritical and self-indulgent practices of religious leaders (John Strohman)

3:4: **John**'s figure must have been startling: God's messenger, but one that did not live, dress, or talk like other religious leaders, who were proper, well-dressed, well-fed, sophisticated, and worldly. **John**'s **garment** was as plain and grab as the wilderness in which he lived, and his diet was as spartan as his clothing: nourishing, but little else. **John**'s very dress, food, and life-style were in themselves a rebuke to the self-satisfied and self-indulgent religious leaders of Israel, as well as a rebuke for others who admired and longed for the same advantages which they did not have. (MacArthur)

3:4: (<u>Pharisees vs John</u>) At the time of Christ, the Pharisees were the chief promoters of pervasive legalistic and ritualistic system. Over the centuries various rabbis had interpreted and reinterpreted the Jewish Scriptiures until those interpretations — known as the traditions of the elders — became more authoritative than Scripture itself. The essence of the traditions was a system of dos and don’ts that gradually expanded to cover almost every aspect of Jewish life. Total observance was impossible and doubtlessly resulted in terrible feelings of guilt. Som religious leaders developed the idea that if a person could perfectly keep just a few of the laws, God would understand.
**John** was radically different from the scribes, Pharisees, Sadducees and priests, and it was obvious that he did not bother to observe most of the religious traditions. He was a breath of fresh air in a stifling, never-ending system of demands and prohibitions. This has probably contributed to the initial popularity of John the Baptist: people wanted someone who could show them how to be forgiven, someone who would show the way of salvation, the real was to please God, the true way of peace and relief frm sin. (MacArthur)

3:5: John called people away from the corrupt and dead religious system of his day: away from ritualism, worldliness, hypocrisy and superficiality. He called away from the cities into the wilderness, where most people would not bother to go if they were not serious seekers. (MacArthur)

3:5: The people were travelling a considerable distance because they recognized John as a prophet (Mt 21:26: "they all hold that John was a prophet"). (MacArthur)

3:6: That those Jews submitted to **being baptized** was more than a little significant, because that was not a traditional Jewish ceremony. It was completely different from the Levitical washings, which consisted of washing the hands, feet, and head, and were repeated: repeated purification for repeated sinning. 
John's washing, however, was one-time. The only one-time washing the Jews performed was for Gentiles, signifying their coming as outsiders into the true faith of Judaism. A Jew who submitted to such a rite demonstrated, in effect, that he was an outsider who sought entrance into the people of God: an amazing admission for a Jew. Members of God's chosen race, descendants of Abraham, heirs of the covenant of Moses, came to John to be **baptized** like a Gentile!
The act symbolized before the world that they realized their national and racial descent, or even their calling as God's chosen and covenant people, could not save them. They had to repent, forsake sin, and trust in the Lord for salvation. They had to come into the kingdom just like the Gentiles, through repentance and faith — which included a public **confession** of sins. (MacArthur)

3:6: We know that many of those acts of repentance must have been superficial and hypocritical, because John soon lost much of his following. (MacArthur)

3:7-13: The parallel account of John's preaching in Lk 3:10-14 gives more details; but the message is the same: a call to repentance and baptism, an inner change of mind and heart, along with an outward act that symbolized that change, and along with a manner of living that *demonstrated* the change. (MacArthur)

3:7: **The Pharisees**. Jesus exposed them as doing "all their deeds to be seen by others" (Mt 23:5). The word *Pharisee* means "separated ones", and members of the sect diligently tried to live up to their name. They separated themselves from everyone whom they considered to be base "sinners". After leaving any public gathering, they would perform ceremonial washings to purify themselves of possible contamination from touching some unclean person.
Upon admission to the group, there was a period of probation lasting up to one year, during which the applicant had to prove his ability to follow ritual law. They formed a self-righteous, "holy" community of legalistic isolationists who had no regard or respect for those outside their sect (Jn 7:49: "this crowd that does not know the law is accursed"). They considered themselves to be superspiritual and the only true Israel, but their "spirituality" was entirely external, consisting of the pursuit of meticulous observance of a multitude of religious rituals and taboos, most of which they had devised over the centuries as supplements to the law of Moses. These were known collectively as "the tradition of the elders", concerning which Jesus gave the Pharisees one of His strongest rebukes, charging them with "teaching as doctrines the precepts of men" (Mt 15:2-9).
By the time of Christ, the Pharisees had lost most of whatever nationalism they may earlier have had. Another sect, the Zealots, had become the association for those whose primary concern was Jewish independence. The Pharisees' single loyalty was to themselves, to their traditions and to their own influence and prestige. By their strict adherence to those traditions they expected to reap great reward in heaven. But they were the epitome of religious emptiness and hypocrisy, as Jesus often pointed out (MacArthur)

3:7: **The Sadducees**. The name may be derived from Zadok, the priest under David.  Also arose during the intertestamental period, but from among the priestly aristocracy, and in the NT times, the priests were mostly sadducees. They were compromisers, cared little for Greek culture of philosophy and intellectualism, but were greatly attracted to the pragmatic, practical Romans.
They claimed to accept the law of Moses, but scorned the legalistic traditions of the Pharisees, and cared little for religion, especially doctrine. They denied the existence of angels, the resurrection, even spirits, and most things supernatural. Consequently, they lived only for the present, getting everything they could from whomever they could. They believed in extreme human autonomy and in the unlimited freedom of the will. They considered themselves masters of their own destinies.
They were fewer, and extremely wealthy. Under Annas, they ran the Temple franchise: the money exchanging and the sale of sacrificial animals, and charged exorbitantly for those services. It was therefore the Sadducees' business that Jesus damaged (Mt 21:12-13).
Because of their great wealth, Temple racketeering, and affiliation with the Romans, the Sadducees were much less popular with their fellow Jews. (MacArthur)

3:7: **The Pharisees and the Sadducees** had almost nothing in common. The P. were ritualistic; the S. were rationalistic. THe P. were strict separatists; the S. comprising collaborators. The p. were commoners (most of them had a trade), while the S. were aristocrats. Both groups had members among the scribes and were represented in the priesthood, and in the Sanhedrin; yet they were in almost constant opposition to each other. During NT times, about the only common ground they exhibited was opposition to Christ and His followers.
The P. expected their reward in heaven, while the S. expected theirs in this life, but the trust of both groups was in personal works and self-effort. Both emphasized the superficial and nonessential, and had no concern for the genuine inner spiritual life of for the welfare of their fellow man. That was "the leaven of the Pharisees and Sadducees," the hypocritical, self-serving, dead externalism about which Jesus warned His disciples (Mt 16:6). (MacArthur)

3:7: The Pharisees and Sadducees were **coming to his baptism** likely not to be baptized, but to check as thoroughly as they could whether John might indeed be a prophet, as many of the people believed. Whatever their reasons were, they were wrong, wicked reasons. (MacArthur)

3:7: It may seem strange: why is John so harsh to them? It is because these **Pharisees** did not repent, nor did they come to be baptized; they actually came to condemn John (see Lk 7:30: they "rejected the purpose of God" in John). John, being a prophet, sees in their hearts, and responds to them immediately.

3:7: **John**'s awareness of their insincerity and lack of repentance of the Pharisees is evident in those strong words: as **John** well knew, they had not confessed their sins; they had not changed at all. They were not genuinely seeking the true righteousness that delivers from judgment. (MacArthur).

3:7: He calls them **vipers** because of their hypocritical self-righteousness. They thought themselves to be saved through their dead works. *Dead works* is an attempt to earn God's forgiveness by one's conduct: the good things we do; the bad things we don't do; and religious acts we engage in. This is self-righteousness, it will not save anyone from hell. Salvation comes through repentance and God's forgiveness obtained through faith in Jesus. Even repentance is a gift from God (2 Tim 2:25; Rom 2:4). 

3:7: **Vipers** (*echidna*) were small but very poisonous desert snakes. When still, they looked like a dead branch and were often picked up unintentionally. This is exactly what Paul did when gathering firewood (Act 28:3). By calling them a **brood** (offspring) of **vipers**, John pointed that: 1) their wicked work had been passed on to them by the original serpent; 2) they appeared to be harmless, but their brand of godliness was venomous and deadly, as they "shut off the kingdom of heaven from men" (Mt 23:13). (MacArthur)

3:7-9: “**Who warned you to flee from the wrath to come?**” — meaning, “Do you really think that you don't need to **repent**, but will escape the Final Judgment because you are Jews, descendants of **Abraham**??!”. In terms of salvation, it means nothing.

3:7: The question "**who warned you to flee**" continues the viper figure: after the harvest, a farmer would start a brush-fire, and burning stalks would cause vipers and other creatures to **flee** before the flames. It was a common sight. The implication is that the Pharisees and Sadducees were expecting John's baptism to give protection from the flames of **the wrath to come**. It was satan, and not genuine fear of God's judgment, that led them out to hear John and to seek his baptism as a pretentions formality. (MacArthur)

3:7: “что это вы повылезали, как змеи боящиеся подступающего пламени? Чувствуете приближение" страшного дня Господня, каяться собрались?”

3:8,10: The actual situation is described here: in order to enter the Kingdom of Heaven, one has to **repent** and **bear fruit** of repentance, i.e. to demonstrate the reality of your repentance by your deeds. 

3:8: John goes on to explain that baptism alone does not give protection from the flames of the wrath to come; but true **repentance** and conversion *do* protect from God's wrath and judgment. (MacArthur)

3:8: Salvation is not verified by a past act, but by present **fruit**fulness. The marks of a truly repentant heart are **fruit in keeping with repentance**. But, as James points out, a faith that has no works is dead (Jas 2:17). (MacArthur)

3:8: *Axios* (**in keeping with**) has the root idea of having equal weight or worth, and therefore of being appropriate. True **repentance** not only should, but *will*, have correspondingly genuine works, demonstrated in both attitudes and actions. Right relationship with God brings right relationship to our fellow human beings. Those who claim to know Christ, who claim to be born again, will demonstrate a new way of living that corresponds to the new birth. (MacArthur)

3:8: John actually explained how to **bear fruit**s of repentance. In v.2, he says: "make His paths straight". What paths? The paths of human lives: the **fruit** is a change of the course of one's life.

3:8: Theologian Erich Sauer speaks of **repentance** as "a threefold action: in the understanding, it means and knowledge of sin; in the feelings, it means pain and grief; and in the will, it means a change of mind" and appropriate actions. 
1. Recognition of personal sin is the important first step. But by itself it is useless, even dangerous, because it tends to make a person think that mere recognition is all that is necessary. (Ex 9:27: a hardened pharaoh admitted his sin; 1 Sam 15:24: an insincere Saul confessed his; Lk 18:23: a young rich man went away sorrowful but not repentant; Mt 27:4: even Judas despaired over his betrayal of Jesus; all of these men recognized their sin, yet none of them repented. They were experiencing what Paul called "the sorrow of the world" that "produces death" instead of the "godly sorrow" that "produces a repentance" (2 Cor 7:10)).
2. True repentance  will include a deep *feeling* of wrongdoing and sin against God. It's a sorrow for offense against a holy God. Sorrow over being found out or over suffering hardship or discipline because of our sin is not godly sorrow, and has nothing to do with repentance; that sort of sorrow is but selfish regret, concern for self rather than for God. It merely adds to the original sin.
3. Acknowledgement and feeling do not complete repentance. If it is genuine, it will result in a changed life that bears **fruit in keeping with repentance**. "Create in me a clean heart" (Ps 51:10,13). **Fruit** is always seen in Scripture as manifested behavior (cf. Mt 7:20:  "you will recognize them by their fruit").
(MacArthur)

3:8: Luke gives several examples of the kind of **fruit** John was talking about: share when you have two tunics or food (Lk 3:11), collect no more than you have to (Lk 3:13), do not extort or slander (Lk 3:14). John says, "the one who practices righteousness is righteous" (1 Jn 3:7); and that "if someone says, 'I love God', and hates his brother, he is a liar; for the one who does not love his brother whom he has seen, cannot love God whom he has not seen" (1 Jn 4:20). Our actions *toward our fellow men* are indicators of our true attitude toward God. (To *men*; not to some religious stuff! — me). (MacArthur)

3:8: Ultimately, **repentance** like that is a gift of God. (Ac 5:31: Jesus was exalted "to grant repentance to Israel, and forgiveness of sins"; Ac 11:18: "God has granted to the Gentiles also the repentance that leads to life"; 2 Tim 2:25-26: ...that "God may grant them repentance"). (MacArthur)

3:8: That God fully and freely remits the sins of a penitent is a basic doctrine of Judaism, and was no news to the Pharisees and Sadducees. Rabbis said, "a man can shooot an arrow for a few furlongs, but repentance reaches to the throne of God". Some rabbis maintained that repentance was created even before the Law. The clear meaning of repentance in Judaism has always been a change in man's attitude toward God that results in a moral and religious reformation of the individual's conduct. The great medieval Jewish scholar, Maimonides, said of the traditional Jewish concept of repentance: "What is repentance? Repentance is that the sinner forsakes his sin, puts it out of his thoughts, and fully resolves in his mind that he will never do it again".
P.S. Repentance in the OT: Ezek 33:18-19; Hos 14:1-2; Jon 3:10; Is 1:16-17. 
(MacArthur)

3:8: John had seen absolutely no evidence of true repentance, and he demanded to see such evidence before he would baptize them. John's words to those religious leaders was at once a rebuke and an invitation. "You have shown no evidence of repentance, but now you have opportunity to truly repent if you mean it. Show me that you have turned from your wicked hypocrisy to genuine godliness, and I will be glad to baptize you." (MacArthur)

3:9: Many Jews of NT times believed, and many Orthodox Jews of our own say still believe, that simply their Jewishness assures them a place in God's kingdom. The rabbis taught that "all Israelites have a portion in the world to come". They spoke of the "delivering merits of the fathers," who passed on spiritual merit to their descendants. Some even taught that **Abraham** stood guard at the gates of Gehenna, or hell, turning back any Israelite who happened that way.
The Jews generally considered Gentiles to be the occupants of hell: spiritually lifeless and hopeless, dead stones. It may be that John played on that figure in declaring that "God is able from these **stones** to raise up children to **Abraham**"; that is, true children of Abraham who come to the Lord as Abraham did, by faith.
John's message of preparation for the coming of the King was repentance, conversion, and a demand for a completely different life — which must have been startling news for Jews who thought that children of Abraham were unconditionally assured of the promised King. John knew what they were probably thinking, and continued, saying that God was not interested in His people's human heritage, but in their spiritual life. John's point was simple: "Unless you repent and are converted from sin to righteousness, you are in the same condition as the Gentiles and have no right to the Kingdom." Some Jews would be saved, but none apart from personal repentance and conversion.
Jesus contradicted the similar claims of another group of Pharisees: "If you are **Abraham**'s children, do the deeds of Abraham" (Jn 8:39-40). Our Lord went on to say that their deeds proved that their father was actually satan. In Jesus' story of the rich man and Lazarus, it is overlooked that the rich man in hell addresses Abraham as "Father", and Abraham, speaking from heaven, calls him his "Child" (Lk 16:25-26). A child of Abraham in hell was beyond their thinking. As with Mt 8:10-12, where Jesus plainly says that "the sons of the kingdom shall be cast out into the outer darkness".        
(MacArthur)

3:9: Descent from Abraham is a great advantage in knowing and understanding God's will (Rom 3:1-2: much benefit; Rom 9:4-5: "to them belong the adoption, the glory, the covenants, the giving of the law, the worship, and the promises"), but without faith in Him that advantage becomes a more severe condemnation. (MacArthur)

3:10: At the end of every harvest season, the farmer would go through his vineyard or orchard looking for plants that had borne **no fruit**. These would be **cut down** to make room for productive vines and trees and to keep them from taking nutrients from the soil that were needed by the good plants. A fruitless tree was a worthless and useless tree, fit only to be **cut down and thrown into the fire**. Fruitless repentance is worthless and useless; it means absolutely nothing to God. (MacArthur)

3:10: The OT prophets, judgment was closely connected with salvation in the coming of the Messiah: those men of God saw no gap between His coming to save and His coming to judge. Apparently, John also believed that God's ultimate judgment was imminent: **fire** was a frequent biblical symbol fo the torment of divine punishment and judgment. John's preaching picked up where Malachi left off (Mal 4:1: evildoers burned on the day like in a furnace). (MacArthur)

3:11: Baptism with the **Spirit** gives the ability to repent and live a holy life; **Fire** purifies the believer, makes him holy.

3:11: **Baptism** means immersion. **Baptism with fire** is therefore an immersion into fire.

3:11: With the message of judgment, John also gives a measure of hope and consolation, speaking specifically of the Messiah, who had come in order that no one need face God's judgment. First, John explains how his baptism differed from that of the Messiah. 
John's **baptism** reflected a ritual the Jews often used when a Gentile accepted the God of Israel. The ceremony was the mark of an outsider becoming a part of the chosen people. In John's ministry it marked the outward profession of inward **repentance**, which prepared a person for the coming of the King. 
The second **baptism** is by the Messiah and with **the Holy Spirit**, who came at Pentecost, baptizing the disciples and establishing them in the body of Christ (ac 2:1-4). It is the Spirit that had been promised in the OT (Joel 2:28: "will pour out on all mankind"; Ezek 36:25-26: "give them a new heart and put a new spirit withing them"), when men would be at last baptized in the very power and person of God Himself.
The third baptism mentioned here is that of **fire**. Many interpreters take this to be a part of the Holy Spirit baptism at Pentecost, which was accompanied by "tongues *as of* of fire". But they were not fire, just looked like licks of fire. Also, when other people who were baptized with the Holy Spirit, no fire was present (Ac 10:44: Cornelius). Other interpreters take the **fire** to represent a spiritual cleansing, as described in Ezekiel; but nothing in the passage relates to cleansing fire. Consequently, it seems best to consider fire as representing God's coming judgment, as is so frequently in Scripture. Also, in both preceding and following verses (vv. 10, 12), John clearly uses fire to represent judgment and punishment. It is impossible that the middle reference to fire would concern an entirely different subject. Both of the adjoining verses contrast the fates of believers and unbelievers, those who bear good fruit and those who do not (v. 10), and the valuable wheat and the worthless chaff (v. 12). It therefore seems logical and natural to take v. 11 also as a contrast between believers (those baptized with the Holy Spirit) and unbelievers (those baptized with the fire of God's judgment).
(MacArthur)

3:11: One of the lowliest tasks of a slave in that day was removing the sandals of his master and any guests and then washing their feet. It was the symbol Jesus Himself used in teaching His disciples to be servants (Jn 13:5-15). The humility of John, one mark of his spiritual stature, is evident in this description of the One he heralded.

3:12: Those that belong to Jesus will be **clear**ed and **gather**ed; those that do not belong to Him will be **burn**ed.

3:12: In Palestine, as in many other parts of the ancient world, farmers made a **threshing floor** by picking out a slight depression in the ground, or digging one if necessary, usually on a hill where breezes could be caught. The soil would then be wetted and packed down until it was very hard. Around the perimeter of the floor, which was perhaps 30 or 40 feet in diameter, rocks would be stacked to keep the grain in place. After the stals of grain were placed onto the floor, an ox, or a team of oxen, would drag heavy pieces of wood around over the grain, separating the **wheat** kernels from the **chaff**, or straw. Then the farmer would take a **winnowing fork** and throw a pile of grain into the air. The wind would blow the chaff away, while the kernels, being heavier, would fall back to the floor. Eventually, nothing would be left but the good and useful **wheat**.
In a similar way the Messiah will separate out everyone who belongs to Him and, like a farmer, **He will gather His wheat into the barn**, where it will be forever safe and protected. Also, in a similar way, **He will burn up the chaff with unquenchable fire**. The long-awaited Messiah will Himself perform both functions, though not in the time and sequence that John and the prophets before him may have thought. The final separation and the ultimate judgment will be only at Christ's second coming.
(MacArthur)

3:13: **Then**. At this point, Jesus "was about 30 years of age" (Lk 3:23), and John was about six months older than Jesus (Lk 1:26). John must have preached for a while already; perhaps, nearly a year (Lk 3:1-2). (MacArthur)

3:13: As with the magi, **came** (*paraginomai*; better, "arrived") is a word that was often used to indicate an official or public appearance. Matthew continues describing the life of the King: His ancestry, His arrival, His adoration, His attestation, His announcement, and now, His annointing. (MacArthur)

3:13: Jesus **came from **from Nazareth (Mk 1:9) in **Galilee**, probably to a place near Jericho (Jn 1:18: Bethany beyound the Jordan). That's 130km, and it has taken Him more than 5 days to get there (a traveller could cover as much as 25km a day on foot). Jesus came **to John** specifically **to be baptized by him**: the purpose of the Journey. (MacArthur)

3:14: The idea of Jesus' being **baptized** by John was unthinkable to him (*diekoluen*: he "kept trying to prevent Him"), for John knew his divine identity (Jn 1:29: "Behold, the Lamb of God!"). John's baptism was for confession of sin and repentance, but Jesus had no sins to confess or be forgiven of. John did not directly contradict Jesus, as Peter would do (Mt 16:22), but he thought that he surely misunderstood what Jesus intended, that He could not possibly mean what He seemed to be saying. John's baptism for repentance from sin was totally inappropriate for Jesus: the one who "takes away the in of the world" (Jn 1:29) cannot himself be sinful. (MacArthur)

3:14: John resisted **baptizing** Jesus for exactly the opposite reason that he resisted baptizing the Pharisees and Sadducees: those were in great need of repentance but were unwilling to ask for it and gave no evidence of having it; Jesus, by contrast, alone of all mankind had no need of repentance (Heb 4:15: "yet without sin"). Pharisees were totally unworthy of it; Jesus was too worthy for it. (MacArthur)

3:15: "**Permit it this time**" was an idiom meaning that the act, though not seemingly appropriate, was indeed appropriate for this special **time**. Jesus gave permission for John to do what, without divine instruction, he would never have been willing to do, because of his deep spiritual commitment and sincerity. His baptism was important for both of their ministries, "**for us**"** to fulfill all righteousness**, for God's plan to be perfectly fulfilled. There was no other way to fulfill all righteousness. (MacArthur)

3:15: Why did Jesus want to submit Himself to an act that testified to confession and repentance of sin? Views:  1) He intended His baptism to be a sort of initiatory rite for His high priesthood, reflecting the ceremony which prepared the OT priests for their ministry.  2) Jesus wanted to identify Himself with the Gentiles, who were initiated into Judaism as proselytes by the act of baptism.  3) To endorse John's authority, to accredit of John as a true prophet of God and the genuine forerunner of His own ministry.  4) He intended to be baptized vicariously for the sins of mankind, making His baptism, along with His atoning death on the cross, a part of His sin-bearing, redemptive work.  5) Gnostics believed that until His baptism, Jesus was just an ordinary man, sinful like every other man, and baptism was therefore necessary to purify Him and make Him suitable to receive the "Christ Spirit", by which He was endowed with deity by the divine *logos*. Like the rest of the Gnostic views, this idea does not square with Scripture: Jesus was *born* the Son of God (Lk 1:32, 35) and was called "Immanuel" even before His birth.
But none fit the context. It seems that one reason Jesus submitted to baptism was to give an example of obedience to His followers. As with taxes: Jesus may not have had an ultimate obligation to pay taxes to human government (Mt 17: 26: "the sons [of the kingdom] are exempt"), but He modeled obedience.
Jesus came into the world to identify with men; and to identify with men is to identify with sin. His baptism represented the willing identification with the sinful people He came to save. He who had no sin took His place among those who had no righteousness. (MacArthur)

3:16: John's **baptism** represented cleansing, or washing, from sin. Christian baptism **represents** the believer's identification with Christ's death and ressurrection (Rom 6:4 &amp;amp;&amp;amp; Col 2:12: "we are buried with Him in baptism"). Jesus made only two other references to personal baptism, and each related to His death (Lk 12:50: "I have a baptism to undergo"; Mk 10:38: "Are you able.. to be baptized with the baptism with which I am baptized?"). (MacArthur)

3:16: **Baptism **(*baptizo*) means literally "to immerse": to dip and object into water or other liquid, not to have the liquid put on the object. The Christian church knew no form of baptism but immersion until the MIddle Ages, where the practice of sprinkling or pouring was introduced by the Roman Catholic church, which itself had previously always baptized by immersion. (MacArthur)

3:16: That Jesus **went up immediately from the water** indicates that He had been all the way into the water. John was baptizing *in* the Jordan (v. 6), and his custom was to baptize where "there was much water" (Jn 3:23). (MacArthur)

3:16: "Just as the veil of the Temple was rent in twain to symbolize the perfect access of all men to God, so here he heavens are **rent asunder** to show how near God is to Jesus, and Jesus is to God." (MacArthur; quoting someone)

3:16: To the Jewish mind of that day, the **dove** was associated with sacrifice. Bullocks were sacrificed by the rich, and lambs by the middle class, but most of the people were poor and could only afford a dove. (MacArthur)

3:16: Why did the **Holy Spirit** come upon Jesus? When He became a man, Jesus did not lose His divinity. He was still fully God in every way. In His deity He needed nothing; but in His humanity He was here being anointed for service and granted strength for ministry. The Spirit anointed Him for His kingly service. "The Spirit of the Lord God is upon me, because the Lord has *anointed* me to bring good news to the afflicted; He has sent me to bind up the brokenhearted, to proclaim liberty to captives, and freedom to prisoners" (Is 61:1). The Spirit gave him strength, and empowered Him to to miracles (MacArthur).

3:17: No OT sacrifice, no matter how carefully selected, had ever been truly pleasing to God, for no animal was perfect, and the blood of those animals was at best only symbolic, "for it is impossible for the blood of bulls and goats to take away sins" (Heb 10:4). But with Jesus God could say He was **well-pleased**. No imperfection could be found in Him, and God was delighted. (MacArthur)




















### Chapter 4

4:1-11: One of the most monumental and mysterious spiritual battles of all time is recounted. The encounter occurred immediately after Jesus' baptism and proved that He was worthy to receive and to reign over the Kingdom. His baptism declared His royalty; His testing demonstrated it. Jesus consistently lived in perfect harmony with the divine plan, and here He demonstrated His power over the prince of this world. (MacArthur)

4:1-11: In this struggle, we are given clear and applicable insights into satan's strategy against God and HIs people, and also into Christ's way of victory over the tempter. (MacArthur)

<a id="id.hftn0e4zt2y9"></a>

4:1: Since the Fall in the Garden of Eden, there's never been an era of man's history when temptation was not a problem. A fifth-century Christian, Polemon (A. D. 450), wrote of his own personal struggle: "Fly from all occasions of temptation, if still tempted fly further still; if there is no escape possible then have done with running away and show a bold face and take the two-edged sword of the Spirit. Some temptations must be taken by the throat, as David killed the lion; others must be stifled, as David hugged the bear to death. Some you had better keep to yourselves and don't give them air; shut them up as a scorpion in a bottle. Scorpions in such confinement die soon but if allowed out for a crawl and then put back into the bottle and corked down they will live a long while and give you trouble. Keep the cork on your temptations, and they'll die of themselves.". See also: Mt 5:29 ("pluck the eye out"). (MacArthur)

4:1: (Перевод) Полемон, верующий, живший в пятом веке, писал про свою личную битву с искушением: "Бегите от каждой возможности к искушению; а если несмотря на это, продолжаете искушаться, то бегите ещё дальше. Если выхода всё равно не найти, то остановитесь и с храбростью обернитесь, взяв в руки обоюдоострый меч Святого Духа. Некоторые искушения нужно брать за горло, как царь Давид, убивший льва; другие же искушения нужно душить, как тот же Давид, умерщвивший медведя. Некоторые искушения нужно держать тихо при себе и не позволять им дышать: закрыть их наглухо, как скорпиона в бутыли. Находясь в такой ловушке, скорпион вскоре умрёт; однако если ему дать хоть иногда выбираться, то он надышится и напитается, и проживёт ещё долго, доставляя вам неприятности. Не забывайте о своих искушениях, держите их под пробкой, и они умрут сами по себе"

4:1: The Spirit **led** (or "impelled") Jesus because of the necessity of Jesus' temptation. Although temptations were given by satan, they were a part of God's perfect plan for the redemptive work of His Son. After thirty years of obscurity, Jesus was now in full consciousness of His divine mission. Then the devil tried to turn Him away: when we are most exhilarated with success, we are also most vulnerable to pride — and to failure. (MacArthur)

4:1: **The wilderness** of Judea is a hot, barren, and desolate area that etends from the Dead Sea almost to Jerusalem, and is some 55km long and 25km wide. George Adam described it as "an area of yellow sand and crumbling limestone. The hills are like dust heaps, the limestone is blistered and peeling, the rocks are bare and jagged". Nowhere in Palestine could Jesus have been more isolated or in less comfort.
Satan met adam in the paradise of Eden, where everything good was provided and nothing harmful existed. Adam lost his battle with satan while in the perfect situation. The Second Adam met satan in the desolate, forbidding wilderness, and won back. 
What better proof can there be that spiritual and moral failure are not caused by circumstances but by the character and response of the one who is tempted? (MacArthur)

4:1: "**To be tested**" (Gk. *peirazo*) is a morally neutral word in Greek that simply means "to test". Whether the testing is for a good or evil purpose depends on the intent of the one giving the test. The fact that **the devil** was doing the testing indicates that Jesus was being **tempted**, enticed to do evil. But God used satan's tempting to evil as His own means of testing for good: to demonstrate the Son's holiness and worthiness. 
James 1:2-4 even tells us to "consider it all joy" when you encounter *testing*, because that is God's purpose — to use satan's temptations as a means of strengthening our faith and of our growing stronger in righteousness. God never tests in the sense of enticing to evil (Jas 1:13: "let no one say, 'I am being tempted by God'"). God never has a part in that sort of testing, but He can and will turn even the worst sort of testing into the right sort, when it is surrendered to His will and power. It's God's great desire to turn into victory what satan intends for failure, to strengthen us at the very point where the adversary wants to find us weak.
(MacArthur)

4:2: **Fasting fourty days**. Even in His perfect humanity, Jesus needed time for thought and for prayer, as we all do. (MacArthur)

4:2: **Hungry**. Hunger not only makes us physically weak but also tends to weaken our moral and spiritual resistance as well. We are especially vulnerable to anything that might provide relief from our present distress. This is where satan usually attacks most fiercely. 
Temptations that have been anticipated, guarded against, and prayed about, have little power to harm us (Mk 14:38: "keep watching and praying, that you may not come into temptation"). Victory over temptations comes from being constantly prepared for it, which, in turn, comes from constantly relying on the Lord. 
It is said that a person travelling in tiger country will not be attached if he sees the tiger before the tiger sees him. Tigers attack from behind in order to surprise their victims, and therefore one of the best defenses against that vicious animal is to face it.
(MacArthur)

4:3-10: (v. 3) The first temptation was for Jesus to distrust the providential care of His Father and to use His own divine powers to serve Himself. (v. 5) The second temptation was for Jesus to presume on the Father's care by putting Him to the test. (v. 8) The third temptation was for Jesus to renounce the way of His Father and to substitute the way of Satan. (MacArthur)

4:3: Mark and Luke seem to indicate that Jesus was **tempted** throughout His stay in the wilderness. (Mk 1:13; Lk 4:2). Possibly, it was the devil's strategy to gradually wear the Lord down little by little before confronting Him with the three great temptations that are specifically recorded. (MacArthur)

4:3: The first temptation was for Jesus to distrust the providential care of His Father and to use His own divine powers to serve Himself (MacArthur)

4:3: The devil's first approach to Jesus had also been his first approach to Eve: to case doubt on God's Word (Gen 3:1: "indeed has God said..?"). (MacArthur)

4:3: Satan was hoping to persuade Jesus to demonstrate His power to verify that it was real. That would mean violating God's plan that He set that power aside in humiliation and used it only when the Father willed. Satan wanted Jesus to disobey God. Affirming His deity and rights as the Son of God would have been to act independently of God. (MacArthur)

4:3: The most obvious part of the temptation was for Jesus to fulfill His legitimate physical needs by miraculous means. But the deeper temptation was satan's appeal to Jesus' supposed rights as the **Son of God**. "Why would you starve, if you are really God's Son?". Jesus was tempted to doubt  the Father's love and provision. He had every right, satan suggested, to use His own divine posers to supply what the Father had not. (MacArthur)

4:4: Jesus had come in His incarnation to do the Father's will. Indeed, His will and the Father's were exactly the same (Jn 4:34: "My food is to do the will of Him"). It was that absolute trust and submission that satan sought to shatter. To have succeeded would have put an irreparable rift in the Trinity. Satan tried to fracture the very nature of God Himself. (MacArthur)

4:4: To every temptation, Jesus **answers** with **God**'s Word. To be specific, with verses from Deuteronomy.

4:4: Jesus declared that food is not the most important part of life, but the power of God is the only real source of man's existence. We are better off to obey and depend on **God**, waiting on His provision, than to impatiently and selfishly provide for ourselves in ways that disobey, or in any way compromise, His word. The central motive of our lives should be to please God and to trust Him to supply everything we need. If we live by faith in Him and in obedience to His Word, we will never lack anything we really need (Php 4:19: "God shall supply all your needs"; Mt 6:8: "knows before we ask"; Mt 6:33: "seek first His kingdom"). (MacArthur)

4:5: The second temptation was for Jesus to presume on the Father's care by putting Him to the test (MacArthur)

4:5: Josephus reports that the drop from **the pinnacle** to the valley floor was some 137 meters. That's 41 stories. (MacArthur)

4:5: According to early tradition, James, the head of the Jerusalem church and the brother of Jesus, was martyred by being thrown from that portico that this very **pinnacle** crowned. (MacArthur) 

4:5: The devil was saying: "Prove to yourself and to the world that you are** the Son of God**. If You won't use your *own* divine power to help yourself, let your Father use *His* divine power to help you.". In the eyes of many Jews, such an act would have been a sure proof of His messiahship. 
According to William Barclay, that is exactly the sort of proof many purported messiahs of that day were trying to give: a man named Theudas promised to split the waters of Jordan; an Egyptian claimed he would lay flat the walls of Jerusalem; Simon the magician (from Act 8:9) tried the very feat with which satan tempted Jesus: jumping off the top of the Temple. All of them have failed and lost their following.
Sensationalism has always appealed to the flesh, but Jesus warned that false prophets would "show great signs and wonders" (Mt 24:24), but such signs do not produce faith. Even when they are from God, they only strengthen the faith of those who already believe. Demanding sensational proof is not evidence of faith but of doubt; it is masked unbelief. For those who believe in God, it is more than evident that He already has proved Himself.
(MacArthur)

4:7: No matter how noble and important we may think our reasons are, to **test God** is to doubt God. And to doubt God is not to trust Him, and not to trust Him is sin. Satan tried to induce Jesus to sin, which would shatter His perfect holiness and separate Him from the Father. (MacArthur)

4:7: To live recklessly and carelessly, and then expecting God to bail us out when we get in trouble, is to presume upon His grace. Those who willingly put themselves in the way of danger and temptation often end up blaming God when harm comes from their foolishness. When the Lord confronted Adam, he blamed God: "the woman *whom You gave*" (Gen 3:12).
When we risk our prestige, money, lives, families, or anything else to fulfill the Lord's calling, we can rest confidently in His divine provision. But when we take risks simply to fulfill our own ambitions, He gives no promise on which we can rest. (MacArthur)

4:8: The third temptation was for Jesus to renounce the way of His Father and to substitute the way of Satan. (MacArthur)

4:9: The devil tried to appeal to the "lust of the eyes" when he showed Jesus the kingdoms and suggested that He can immediately have them all, rather than experience the hard way of the Cross (John Strohman)

4:9: Satan now drops all pretense and reveals his supreme purpose: to induce Jesus to worship him. He first suggested what Jesus ought to do for Himself. Next he suggested what the Father ought to do for Jesus. Now he suggests what satan could do for Jesus — in exchange for what Jesus could do for him. (MacArthur)

4:8: By some supernatural accommodation the devil showed Jesus the glories of Egypt — it pyramids, temples, libraries, and vast treasures. He showed the power and splendor of Rome, with its mighty empire spread over the known world. He showed great Athens, magnificent Corinth, and of course wondrous Jerusalem, the royal city of David. And as Jesus had a divine right to all **kingdoms**, satan appealed to that right in this last temptation. "Why wait and suffer for what is already rightfully yours? Why submit as a Servant when you could reign as a King? I am only offering you what the Father has already promised.". But what the Father has promised to the Son because of His righteous obedience, satan offered on his own corrupt terms: in exchange for His unrighteous disobedience. 
Satan always comes at us in that way. All we must do to get those things of the world is to go after them in the way of the world, which is satan's way. When we set out hearts on money, prestige, popularity, power, or selfish happiness, we are doing exactly what satan wanted Jesus to do: put self first and God last. Self-will is satan's will, and is therefore the opposite of God's will, which is for us to "seek first His kingdom and His righteousness" (Mt 6:33). 
Satan is a counterfeiter: he offers what seems to be the same as what God offers, but easier. "Just cut a corner here and there, turn your head a little at questionable practices, give in when it's advantageous, don't be a prude, follow the crowd. That's the way to success". The basic argument is always a form of the idea that the end justifies the means.
But satan is also the father of lies. His price is always immeasurably more than he leads us to believe. And what he gives is always immeasurably less than he promises. For Jesus to have given in to any of these temptations would have brought the same ultimate result: to be disqualified Himself both as King and as Savior. The statement of those who mocked at the foot of the cross would have had to have been reversed: "He saved Himself; others He cannot save" (Mt 27:42). Instead of redeeming the world, He would have joined the world.
(MacArthur)

4:10: Satan tempted **Jesus** to misuse His power, but instead Jesus used the very same power to command satan to leave. Because satan's present power is only by God's permission, he had no choice but to obey and to leave until "an opportune time" (Lk 4:13). (MacArthur)

4:10: The Lord gives all of His children the power to resist satan (Jas 4:7: "resist the devil, and he will free from you"). For every temptation satan leads us into, a way out is provided by the Father (1 Cor 10:13: “will provide a w        ay of escape”). (MacArthur)

4:11: Satan’s temptations failed, but God’s testings succeeded. He would trust the Father, He would not presume on His word, and He would not circumvent His will. The King was accredited by the severest test. (MacArthur)

4:12: **John** was a bridge between the OT and the NT. During that first year of Jesus’ ministry, their two ministries overlapped. As John’s work began to phase out, Jesus’ work began to build. (Jn 3:30: “He must increase, but I must decrease”). (MacArthur)

4:12: We learn from John that about a year elapsed between Jesus’ wilderness temptations and the events recorded here: Him **withdrawing to Galilee** and beginning to preach there. During that time: John testified to Jesus’ messiahship (Jn 1:29: “takes away the sin of the world”; Jn 1:34: “the SOn of God”); two disciples of John left him to follow Jesus (Jn 1:35-37). Other highlights of that year: first miracle at the wedding at Cana (Jn 2:1-11); His cleansing of the Temple (2:12-25); His testimony to Nicodemus (3:1-21); the final public testimony of John the Baptist (3:22-36); Jesus’ ministry in Samaria at Sychar (4:1-42). (MacArthur)

4:12: Jesus’ official ministry began when **John** went to jail. This was according to His Father’s diving timetable (Gal 4:4: “when the fullness of the time came”; Jn 2:4: “My hour has not yet come”). (MacArthur)

4:12: Matthew does not explain John’s **arrest** until 14:3-12

4:12: Even though **withdrew** (Gk. anachoreo) is often used to convey the thought of escaping danger, Jesus had no fear of Herod. Had He wanted to escape possible trouble from Herod, He would not have gone to **Galilee**, because that, too, was under Herod’s control.
In John, we find that Jesus left Judea because “the Pharisees had heard that Jesus was making and baptizing more disciples than John” (Jn 4:1-3). Though the Pharisees had come to hate John, they dared not take action; even several years later they would not speak ill of him for “fear of the multitude” (Mt 21:26). They were greatly pleased, however, when Herod did what they themselves wanted, but were afraid, to do. When they learned that Jesus was gaining a larger following even than John, their hatred would soon turn against Him as well. 
Jesus had no fear of Herod nor of the Pharisees, but He wanted to avoid a premature confrontation. It was not yet time for that hatred to be unleashed against Him.
(MacArthur)

4:12: The Roman region of **Galillee** was heavily populated; estimated by some to have had as many as two million people in Jesus’ day. It had long been the breadbasket of central Palestine: the soil was extremely fertile, and the lake furnished great quantities of edible fish. Galileans were less traditional than the people of Jerusalem; perhaps Jesus chose His disciples from that area because they would be less bound to Jewish tradition and more open to the newness of the gospel. (MacArthur)

4:13: Jesus’ hometown **Nazareth** rejected him (Lk 4:16-30: “He went to the synagogue”, read “the scroll of the prophet Isaiah”, but they doubted Him (“is not this Joseph’s son?”) and wanted to “throw Him down the cliff”). (MacArthur)

4:13: **Capernaum** (village of Nahum (=compassion)) would become Jesus’ new hometown (Mt 9:1: “His city”). It was a flourishing, prosperous city. Today, though a popular attraction for Christian visitors, it is virtually uninhabited (Mt 11:23-24: “will you be exalted? you shall descend to Hades!”). (MacArthur)

4:15: **Galilee** was more of a crossroads than Jerusalem, which was isolated from much trade traffic. A famous trade route was actually known as Via Maris (**the way of the sea**. [Wiki: Via Maris](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Via_Maris&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1582399365364000)) and ran through Galilee from Damascus to the Mediterranean. One ancient writer even said that Judea was on the way to nowhere, whereas Galilee was on the way to everywhere. (MacArthur)

4:15: Located on a trade route, **Galilean** Jews had constant association with **Gentiles**, which contributed greatly to their nontraditional character (MacArthur)

4:15: The region of **Galilee** originally had been given to the tribes of Asher, **Zebulun and Naphtali**, but contrary to God’s command, they failed to expel all of the Canaanites, and as a result, those unfaithful Jews suffered the problem of mixed marriages and the inevitable pagan influence which that practice brought. Under the Assyrian rule (XII BC – I BC), it was largely populated by **Gentiles**. Through those disrupting centuries, the Jews that remained in Galilee had been greatly weakened in both biblical and traditional Judaism. Hence the name, **Galilee of the Gentiles**.
It is not strange, then, that the reaction of many Jews in Jerusalem was, “Surely the Christ is not going to come from Galilee, is He?” (Jn 7:41). Yet this is what Isaiah 9:1-2 prophesied: the despised, sin-darkened, rebellious Galileans were the first to glimpse the Messiah. 
Not the learned, proud, and pure Jews of Jerusalem, but the mongrel, downcast, nontraditional mixed multitude of Samaria and Galilee had that great honor. To those who were neediest, and ho were most likely to recognize their need, Jesus went first.
The fact that Jesus did not start with Judea emphasizes the fact that His gospel of salvation was for the whole world, and in no way an accommodation to the proud and exclusive Judaism that had developed during the intertestamental period. The Son of God was sent to be “a light of revelation of the Gentiles, and the glory of Your people Israel” (Lk 2:32).
(MacArthur)

4:16: One of the most beautiful metaphors used to describe Jesus’ nature and character is that of **light**. It conveys the idea of the illuminating, truth-revealing, and sin-exposing ministry of the Son of God. John says: “in Him was life, and the life was the light of men” (Jn 1:4-5); John came to “bear witness to the light… the true light which, coming into the world, enlightens every man” (Jn 1:8-9); “this is the judgment, that the light has come into the world, and men loved the darkness” (Jn 3:19-21). In the OT, *walking in the light* was often used as a figure of righteousness and obedience to God. Now, Jesus presents Himself as the embodiment of righteousness and godliness.  (MacArthur)

4:17: To **preach** (Gk. kerusso) means “to proclaim” or “to publish”, that is, to publicly make a message known. R. C. H. Lenski comments: “The point to be noted is that **to preach** is not to argue, reason, dispute, or convince by intellectual proof, against all of which a keen intellect may bring counterargument. We simply state in public or testify to all men the truth which God bids us state. … Men eigher believe the truth, as all sane men should, or refuse to believe it, as only fools venture o do.”. Jesus preached His message with certainty. He did not come to dispute or to argue, but to proclaim,** to preach**. Preaching is the proclamation of certainties, not the suggestion of possibilities.
Jesus also preached “as one having authority, not as their scribes” (Mt 7:29). For God’s people once again to hear someone preach as the prophets had preached was astonishing.
Jesus preached only what He was commissioned by His Father to preach (Jn 3:34: “for He whom God has sent speaks the words of God”; Jn 12:49: “For I have not spoken on my own authority”).
(MacArthur)

4:17: This verse summarizes the message that Jesus was preaching: **repentance**, and the coming of the **Kingdom of Heaven**. This is similar to John's message (3:2). It is necessary to repent in order to believe. The apostles, when Jesus sent them, also “proclaimed that people should repent” (Mk 6:12). Repentance was the conclusion of Peter’s Pentecost sermon: “repent, and let each of you be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ for the forgiveness of your sins” (Ac 2:38). Many years later, Paul reminded Timothy that repentance leads “to the knowledge of the truth” (2 Tim 2:25).

4:17: **Repent** (Gk. Metanoeite; same word John the Baptist had used) literally means a change of perception, a change in the way we see something. To repent, therefore, is to change the way a person looks at sin and the way he looks at righteousness. It involves a change of opinion, of direction, of life itself. To repent is to have a radical change of heart and will — and, consequently, of behavior (Mt 3:8: “bear fruit in keeping with repentance”). (MacArthur)

4:17: Was this message new to Israel? **Repentance**, of course, had always been in order and had always been needed, but now that **the kingdom of heaven** was **at hand**, it was all the more imperative. Tragically, because most of Israel did not repent and did not recognize and accept the King, the promised earthly kingdom had to be postponed. As Matthew later explains, the literal, physical kingdom was set aside for a period of time. The spiritual kingdom presently exists only in the hearts of those who have trusted in Jesus Christ, the King. He is not ruling the nation Israel and the world as He one day will, but He rules the lives of those who belong to Him by faith. The world does not have peace, but those do who know the Prince of Peace. The external kingdom had not yet come, yet the King Himself indwells those that are His. (MacArthur)

4:17: What did Puritans believe about **repentance**?  Goodwin is representative of them. The British Puritan wrote this: “Where **mourning**” – that is, weeping – “for offending God is wanting” – or lacking – “there is no sign of any good will yet wrought in the heart to God, nor of love to Him, without which God will never accept a man.”  In other words, he’s saying if there’s no mourning over sin it’s evident God hasn’t worked in the heart.  “Else there is no hope of amendment.  God will not pardon till He sees hopes of amendment.  Now until a man confesses his sin, and that with bitterness, it is a sign that he loves it.  Whilst he hides it, spares it, and forsakes it not, it is sweet in his mouth, and therefore till he confess it and mourn for it, it is a sign it is not bitter to him, and so he will not forsake it.  A man will never leave sin till he finds bitterness in it, and if so, then he will be in bitterness for it.  And godly sorrow works repentance.”
Of all the statements that I have read on the subject, the strongest one comes from Charles Haddon Spurgeon.  Listen to what Spurgeon said.  “There must be a true and actual abandonment of sin and a turning unto righteousness in real act and deed in everyday life.  Repentance, to be sure, must be entire.  How many will say, ‘Sir, I will renounce this sin and the other, but there are certain darling lusts which I must keep and hold?’  Oh, sirs, in God’s name let me tell you, it is not the giving up of one sin, nor 50 sins, which is true repentance.  It is the solemn renunciation of every sin.  If thou dost harbor one of those accursed vipers in thy heart, and dost give up every other, that one lust, like one leak in a ship, will sink thy soul.  Think it not sufficient to give up thy outward vices, fancy it not enough to cut off the more corrupt sins of thy life.  It is all or none which God demands.  ‘Repent,’ says He, and when He bids you repent, He means repent of all thy sins, otherwise He can never accept thy repentance as real and genuine.  All sin must be given up or else you will never have Christ.  All transgression must be renounced or else the gates of heaven must be barred against you.  Let us remember, then, that for repentance to be sincere, it must be entire repentance.  True repentance is a turning of the heart as well as of the life.  It is the giving up of the whole soul to God to be His forever and ever.  It is the renunciation of the sins of the heart as well as the crimes of the life,” end quote.  Strong enough? 
(MacArthur)

4:17: **Repentance**. Thayer’s Greek lexicon defines metanoe as, quote: “The change of mind of those who have begun to abhor their errors and misdeeds, and have determined to enter upon a better course of life, so that it embraces both a recognition of sin, and sorrow for it, and hearty amendment, the tokens and effects of which are good deeds,” end quote.  In other words, it’s a redirection of the will that results in a changed behavior.  It’s not merely sorrow for sin, although genuine repentance always has sorrow.  It is a redirection of the human will.  It is a choice to forsake all unrighteousness and pursue holiness.  And please, beloved, it is that redirection of the will that is the work of God.  We’re not talking about something you do; we’re talking about God doing something in you when He saves you.  People say, “Well, you’re teaching that this is some pre-salvation work, and until you clean your life up and repent, you can’t get saved.”  No, repentance is not a pre-salvation attempt to get your life cleaned up.  It is not a call to stop sinning so you can get saved.  Not at all.  It is not just an invitation to turn your back on all evil so Christ will accept you.  It is the thing which God produces in you when He saves you.  It’s an element of saving faith that redirects the will.
J.I. Packer, in his helpful little book, Evangelism and the Sovereignty of God, writes, “The repentance that Christ requires of His people consists in a settled refusal to set any limit to the claims which He may make on their lives.”  It’s not just a mental activity.  There’s an intellectual aspect, let me give you this quickly.  There’s an intellectual aspect.  Repentance involves recognition of sin, recognition of the sinfulness of sin, recognition that sin affronts a holy God.  It involves the intellectual recognition that I’m personally responsible for my sin and my guilt.  It includes the recognition that Christ died for my sin, and that He, as God, wants to rule my life.  That’s the intellectual part of repentance.  Secondly, it has an emotional part.  That recognition produces sorrow, it produces new desires and new impulses, it produces shame. And 2 Corinthians 7:10 says there is a sorrow that leads to repentance.  So it starts out, you see that sin is sinful, you see that you are guilty, you see that Christ has provided intellectually, and then it touches your emotions, and there’s a brokenness, and a sorrow, and a shame, and a guilt that pours out; and out of that sorrow comes the third element, and that is the volitional - the volitional.  Finally, repentance enacts the will, and brings a change of direction, a new determination to abandon stubborn disobedience and surrender your life to Christ.  And then it produces a changed behavior.  Where there’s no changed behavior, repentance may have been intellectual, and it may have been emotional, but it was never volitional.  It redirects the will when it’s genuine.
Thirdly, and as a result, it’s life-changing.  It’s life-changing.  It’s an element of saving faith, it activates the will, redirects it, and it’s life-changing.  That’s why John said, “Bring forth fruit meet for repentance.”  You say you repent; let’s see your life.  Demonstrate it.  Real repentance alters the character of a person.  One of my heroes, the men that I esteem highly, is Martyn Lloyd-Jones.  One of the books that’s blessed me that he wrote has to do with the Sermon on the Mount.  In it, he writes this – he’s now with the Lord – “Repentance means that you realize that you are a guilty, vile sinner in the presence of God, that you deserve the wrath and punishment of God, that you are hell-bound.  It means that you begin to realize that this thing called sin is in you, and that you long to get rid of it, and that you turn your back on it in every shape and form.  You renounce the world, whatever the cost, the world in its mind and outlook, as well as its practices, and you deny yourself and take up the cross, and go after Christ.  Your nearest and dearest, and the whole world, may call you a fool, or say you have religious mania; you may have to suffer financially, but it makes no difference.  That is repentance.”
(MacArthur)

4:18: They **cast the net** from the shallow water along the shore; to use a large dragnet in the deep water, they’d have to use two or more boats. The net therefore was about 3 meters in diameter. (MacArthur) 

4:19: God always chooses Himself partners: Noah, Abraham, Moses and David. He chose Israel herself to be a whole nation of priests. Here, Jesus calls fishermen to evangelism: the called ones are themselves to become callers. (MacArthur)

4:19: Jesus promised to **make** them **fishers of men**. As He later would make clear, they could never be effective disciples in any way without His power (Jn 15:5: “apart from me you can do nothing”). 
Moreover, He trained them. First, by sending the disciples out two-by-two on brief missions. After three years of teaching and training He finally left them permanently — but with the paraclete.
(MacArthur)

4:19: A number of qualities that make a good fisherman can also help make a good evangelist. 1) Be patient: it often takes time to find a school of fish; 2) have perseverance: not just wait, but go from place to place over and over — until the fish are found; 3) good instinct for the right time: poor timing has lost many a catch; 4) courage: readiness to face considerable danger from storms and various mishaps. 5) knowing when to get out of sight: getting in the way of our witnessing may cause people to turn away. A good soul-winner keeps himself out of the picture as much as possible. (MacArthur)

4:20: “**Followed**” conveys the idea of following as a disciple who is committed to imitating the one he follows. (MacArthur) 

4:20: This is not the first time that Peter meets Jesus; the first encounter had happened before, in Jn 1:41 (Andrew finds his brother, Peter, and says: “We have found the Messiah”). In a parallel episode in Lk 5:1-11 Peter even lets Jesus enter his boat to preach, and then obeys His word to cast the nets. Thus, Peter's decision is not to follow a complete stranger, but Someone he had known. (me)
Still, they had little knowledge of Jesus’ teaching or of what following Him would cost. But it was enough for them to know who He was and that His call to them was a divine call. (MacArthur)

4:20: The disciples’ obedience was instant: **they immediately left the nets and followed Him.** The sovereign authority of the Lord has spoken. (MacArthur)** **

4:21: These three, James, Peter and John, were later esteemed “pillars” among the apostles (Gal 2:9)

4:21: The disciple had little education and little spiritual perception. They did not understand the parables. They rebuked those who brought children to Jesus (Mt 19:13). They slept in Gethsemane (Mt 26:40,45). Peter rebuked Jesus (Mt 16:22). They argued who was the greatest (Mk 9:34). Peter denied Jesus (M 26:33-35). All disciples deserted Jesus on the cross (Mt 26:56). At the time of their calling, the disciples were selfish, proud, weak, and cowardly. They showed little potential even for dependability, much less for greatness. Yet Jesus chose them for disciples, even to be His inner circle of twelve. They were raw material that He would make into useful instruments. (MacArthur)

4:21: All the disciples were probably not as rough and unpromising as the pillars, but *not one was chosen from among the Jewish religious leaders* (!). It was no doubt partly that fact that caused those leaders to reject Jesus. It was beyond their comprehension that the Messiah would bypass the proper leaders of His chosen people when He came to establish His kingdom.
The only apostle who had been a Jewish religious leader was not among the original twelve, and he considered himself “one untimely born”. He knew that his own calling was exceptional and reflected God’s exceeding grace (1 Cor 15:8-10: “untimely born”, “unworthy”, “by the grace”).
He reminded the Corinthian believers, “For consider your calling, brothers: not many of you were wise according to worldly standards, not many were powerful, not many were of noble birth. But God chose what is foolish in the world to shame the wise; … so Let the one who boasts, boast in the Lord”. (1 Cor 1:26-29).
(MacArthur)

4:23: Matthew introduces Jesus’ ministry of **teaching**, preaching and **healing**. (MacArthur)

4:23: Travelling **throughout Galilee**, He ministered to as many people as He possibly could. He did not have to visit every village: because the entire region was only 100km×50km, anyone interested in seeing and hearing Him would not have had far to travel. (MacArthur)

4:23: By NT times, **synagogues** had become the most important institution in Jewish life. Many Jews lived thousands of miles from Jerusalem’s Temple and could never expect to visit there. The synagogue is believed to have developed during the Babylonian exile. 
It was not only the primary place of worship, but also of study, community fellowship, and of legal activity. The greatest tragedy for most Jews was to be disfellowshipped from the synagogue. This is what happened to Jews who became Christians, and this is the reason many Jews refused to.
Worship was held of Sabbaths (starting friday evening): sections of Torah were read and expounded. Often visiting dignitaries or rabbis would be given the honor of expounding the Scripture: a practice of which Jesus and Paul took advantage on numerous occasions.
Ten elders usually administered a synagogue, of whom 3 were called “rulers”. One elder interpreted the Scripture into the vernacular, one headed the theological school, and one teaching people. During Roman rule, the synagogue officials had the power to settle virtually every legal dispute within their congregations and even to inflict punishment (with the exception of execution).
The synagogue served as a public school for boys, where they studied the Talmud and learned to read, write, and to do basic arithmetic. For men, it was a place of advanced theological study.
(MacArthur)

4:23: It was in the **synagogues** that believing, sincere Israelites would be found, and here, if anywhere, Jesus could expect to find those who would hear and accept His divine message. As a travelling rabbi, Jesus was welcomed in most of them in the early part of His ministry. (MacArthur)

4:23: **Teaching** (Gk. *didaskon*) focused on content, with the purpose of discovering the truth — contrary to the forums so popular among Greeks, where discussion and the bantering about of various ideas and opinions was the primary concern. (MacArthur) 

4:23: **Proclaiming** (Gk. *kerusson*), relates simply to announcing a message, unlike “teaching”, which relates to explaining it. The message proclaimed needs to be explained, and vise versa. (MacArthur)

4:23: **Gospel** means “good news”: the good news that the **kingdom** was coming. Around this supreme truth all of His teaching centered. (MacArthur)

4:23: Miracles of **healing** was one of the ways Jesus demonstrated His divine character, His mesianic credentials. Jesus’ healing was a divine verification: His words should have been sufficient evidence of His missiahship, as they were for those who truly believed (Lk 4:22,32: people wondering and amazed at Jesus’ words and authority); but it was also a powerful addition to His teaching and preaching. The miracles are also “an illustration of the nature of His kingdom; they were His first gifts to His kingdom subjects” (Alexander Maclaren). They were a foretaste of His glorious, earthly kingdom. To gen some idea of what the millenial kingdom will be like, we need only multiply His words and His miracles ten-thousandfold. (MacArthur)

4:24: The verse expands the universal character of the healings. **Demons**, **seizures**, **paralytics** characterize the three broad areas of man’s afflictions: the spiritual, the mental, and the physical. Jesus was able to overpower whatever evil affected those who came to Him,** and He healed them**. (MacArthur)

4:24: **Syria** was a Roman province that took in all of Palestine, including Galilee; but here Syria refers only to its northern part. In any case, the point is that Jesus’ fame spread well beyond the area in which He was ministering. (MacArthur)

4:24: “When our Lord came down to earth, He drew heaven with Him. The signs which accompanied His ministry were but the trailing clouds of glory which He brought from heaven, which is His home. [...] It has been said that in effect He banished disease and death from Palestine for three years of His ministry. One touch of the hem of His garment that He wore could heal whole countries of their pain. One touch of His hand could restore life.” (B.B. Warfield)

4:24: Jesus’ miracles accomplished four things above and beyond the immediate and obvious benefit to those who were healed. 1) they proved that He was divine, because no mere human could do such things; 2) showed that God is compassionate toward those who suffer; 3) showed that Jesus was the prophesied Messiah; 4) proved that the coming kingdom was a reality. (MacArthur)

4:24: Six features of Jesus’ **healing**: 1) Jesus healed directly, with a word or touch, without prayer; 2) Jesus healed instantaneously; 3) He healed completely; 4) He healed everyone who came to Him, everyone who was brought to Him, and everyone for whom healing was asked by another, — with no discrimination as to person or affliction; 5) Jesus healed organic and congenital problems, no matter how severe and longstanding; 6) He healed even after disease had run its full course and taken the life of the victim. He brought people back to life. (MacArthur)




















### Chapter 5




















#### The Sermon on the Mount

5:3-7:29: The Sermon is the supreme  model of good preaching, a homiletical masterpiece. It beautifully and powerfully flows from the introduction (5:3-12) to the first point (the citizens of the kingdom, 5:13-16), to the second point (the righteousness of the kingdom, 5:17-7:12), to the third point (the exhortation to enter the kingdom, 7:13-27), and to the conclusion (the effect of the sermon on its hearers, 7:28-29). The transitions from point to point are clear and unmistakable. (MacArthur)

5:1: A rabbi commonly **sat down** when he taught. If he spoke while standing or walking, what he said was considered to be informal and unofficial. But when he sat down, what he said was authoritative and official. (MacArthur)




















#### The Beatitudes

5:2: Until this point, Jesus’ words have been limited; now, in one powerfully comprehensive yet compact message, the Lord sets forth the foundational truths of the gospel of the kingdom He came to proclaim. (MacArthur)

5:2: This teaching is the upside-down version of the world. Our world thinks very highly of wealth, pride, personal power, and the "winner-take-all" mentality. But the kingdom of God is the exact opposite. (John Strohman)

5:2: The ideals and principles in the Sermon on the Mount are utterly contrary to those of human societies and governments. In Christ's kingdom the most exalted persons are those who are the lowliest in the world's estimation. They are characterized in this sermon as being humble, compassionate, meek, yearning for righteousness, merciful, pure in heart, peacemakers, and persecuted for the sake of the very righteousness they practice. In the world's eyes those characteristics are the marks of losers. 
But this standard of living counters everything the world practices and holds dear. 
To live by the standards He gives here is to live a life of blessed happiness: one that results in joy instead of despair, in peace instead of conflict — a peace that the world does not understand and cannot have (Jn 14:27: “not as the world gives”; Php 4:7: “surpasses all understanding”). It is a blessedness not produced by the world or by circumstances, and it cannot be taken away by the world or by circumstances. It is not produced externally and cannot be destroyed externally.
(MacArthur)

5:2: The thrust of the Sermon of the Moung is that the message and work of the King are first and most importantly internal and not external, and spiritual and moral rather than physical and political. His concern is for what men are, because what they are determines what they do. (MacArthur)

5:2: His principles cannot work for those who do not have a transformed nature and God's indwelling power. These are the standards which unglorified human strength cannot continually achieve. One cannot behave like Christ until one becomes like Christ.
The blessedness Christ offers is not dependent on self-effort or self-righteousness, but on the new nature God gives. In God’s Son, man comes to share God’s very nature, which is characterized by true righteousness and its consequence — blessedness, or happiness. (MacArthur)

5:2: Jesus’ new way of living comes from a new way of thinking, and the new way of thinking comes from new life. Those who do not follow them as a general direction of life have an unacceptable righteousness (Mt 5:20: “For I tell you, unless your righteousness exceeds that of the scribes and Pharisees, you will never enter the kingdom of heaven.”).
As the Sermon on the Mount itself makes clear, internal changes also bring external changes. When our attitudes and thinking are right, our actions will fall in line. If our inner life does not make our outer life better, our inner life is deficient or nonexistent. (Jas 2:20: “faith without works is useless”). The true outside life can only be produced from a true inside life.
To claim to follow the spirit without obeying the letter is to be a liar. To follow the letter without following the spirit is to be a hypocrite. To follow the spirit in the right attitude and the letter in the right action is to be a faithful child of God and a loyal subject of the King.
(MacArthur)

5:2: (<u>On the religious climate</u>) The Pharisees believed that right religion consisted in divine laws and religious regulations. They focused on adhering to the laws of the past.
The Sadducees focused on the present. They were the religious liberals who discounted most things supernatural and who modified both Scripture and tradition to fit their own religious philosophy.
The Essenes were ascetics who believed that right religion meant separation from the rest of society. They led austere lives in remote, barren areas such as Qumran.
The Zealots were fanatical nationalists who thought that right religion centered in radical political activism. These Jewish revolutionaries looked down on fellow Jews who would not take up arms against Rome.
In essence, the Pharisees said, “Go back”; the Sadducees said, “Go ahead”; The Essenes said, “Go away”; and the Zealots said, “Go against”. The Pharisees were traditionalists; the Sadducees were modernists; the Essenes were separatists; the Zealots were activists. They represented the same primary types of religious factions that are common today.
But Jesus’ way was not any of those. To the Pharisees He said that true spirituality is internal, not external. To the Sadducees He said that it is God’s way, not man’s way. To the Essenes He said that it is a matter of the heart, not the body. To the Zealots He said that it is a matter of worship, not revolution. The way of His kingdom is first and above all a matter of the inside: the soul. That is the central focus of the Sermon on the Mount. True religion in God’s kingdom is the right attitude toward God and toward other people.
(MacArthur)

5:2: Everything Jesus said **to the multitudes** was spoken publicly, with the intention to drive them to a recognition of their sin, and thus to the need of a Savior. Until they believed in Him, the demands of the sermon could only show them how terribly far they were from meeting God’s standards. (MacArthur)

5:2: When **He taught**, He quoted no sources, no ancient rabbis, no revered tradition. What He spoke, He spoke on His own authority. That was unheard of among the Jews, who always derived their authorty from recognized sources. Yet when Jesus concluded, “the multitudes were amazed at His teaching; for He was teaching them as one having authority, and not as their scribes” (Mt 7:28-29). (MacArthur)

5:2: “**opened His mouth**” was a common colloquialism used to introduce a message that was especially solemn and important. It was also used to indicate intimate, heartfelt, testimony or sharing. Jesus’ sermon was both authoritative and intimate; it was of the utmost importance and was delivered with the utmost concern. (MacArthur)




















#### Introduction: The Beatitudes

5:3-12: The beatitudes emphasize that no human effort can earn those blessings, and one who reads it should be drawn to faith in God for forgiveness since the standard laid out here is impossible for a human to obtain on his own. (John Strohman)

5:3-12: Будучи кротким и смиренным сердцем, Он предложил учение Свое [не как повеление, а как благословение тех], кто его [по своей свободной доброй воле] примет и Будет исполнять. Поэтому в каждом изречении о блаженстве следует рассматривать: [первое,] учение, или заповедь;[второе,] ублажение, или обещание награды. (Православный Катехизис Филаретовский)

5:3-12: (<u>Blessedness</u>) The series of conditional blessings promised in Mt 5:3-12 have long been called “The Beatitudes” (from Old French beatitude or Latin beatitudo, from beatus ‘blessed’: a state of happiness or bliss). Jesus presents the possibility of people being genuinely happy. Happiness that is available is a fitting start for the New Testament’s “good news”. 
Far from being the cosmic killjoy that many accuse Him of being, God desires to save men from their tragic lostness, to give them power to obey His will, and to make them happy. This sermon sets the way of blessedness for those who come to Him.
The word **blessed (**Gk. *Makarios*) means happy, fortunate, blissful. Is used here to describe the state of inward contentedness that is not affected by circumstances but is based on having one’s life right with God. 
Blessedness is a characteristic of God, and it can be a characteristic of men only as they share in the nature of God. It becomes clear that Jesus is speaking of a reality that is only available for believers. 
It is important to remember that the Beatitudes are pronouncements, not probabilities. Men are not *more likely* to be happy if they have these qualities; they are certain divine judgmental pronouncements.
(MacArthur)

5:3-12: (<u>vs the world</u>) The Beatitudes seem paradoxical. By normal human standards such things as humility, mourning, desire for righteousness, mercy, and persecution are not the stuff of which happiness is made. To the natural man, and to the immature or carnal Christian, such happiness sounds like misery with another name. And in a way, it is misery. Jesus teaches that misery endured for the right purpose and in the right way *is* the key to happiness. 
The philosophy of the world is: *things satisfy*. Acquiring things brings happiness, achieving things brings meaning, doing things brings satisfaction. Solomon tried the world’s way to happiness for many years and had plenty of wealth, wisdom, and power, yet he concluded that his life was purposeless and empty. “All is vanity.” (Ecclesiastes)
The tree of happiness cannot grow in a cursed earth. Earthly things cannot bring even lasting earthly happiness, much less eternal happiness. Physical things simply cannot touch the soul, “for one's life does not consist in the abundance of his possessions” (Lk 12:15).
(The opposite is also true: spiritual things cannot satisfy physical needs. When someone is hungry he needs food, not a lecture on grace. When he is hurt, he needs medical attention, not moral advice.)
Jesus didn’t teach that claiming faithfulness to Christ guarantees health, wealth, success, prestige and prosperity. Instead, He warned that physical, worldly advantages most often limit true happiness: they become fuel for pride, lust, and self-satisfaction — the enemies not only of righteousness, but also of happiness.
True blessedness is on a higher level than anything in the world. Here is a completely new way of life, based on a completely new way of thinking. It is in fact based on a new way of being. This standard of righteousness it the standard of selflessness: a standard that is completely opposite to man’s fallen impulses and unregenerate nature. It is impossible to follow Jesus’ new way of living without having His new life within.
(MacArthur)

5:3-12: The Beatitudes are not in random order, but lead to the other in logical succession: being poor in spirit reflects the right attitude we should have to our spiritual condition, which then should lead us to mourn, to be meek and gentle, to hunger and thirst for righteousness, to be merciful, pure in heart, and have a peacemaking spirit. A Christian who has all those qualities will be so far above the level of the world that his life will rebuke the world — which will bring persecution from the world and light to the world. (MacArthur)




















#### “Blessed are the poor in spirit, for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.

5:3: **Blessed** are those who know (see, recognize, acknowledge) that they are **poor in spirit**.

5:3: **poor in spirit** “those devoid of spiritual arrogance, those who regard themselves as insignificant” (AMP)

5:3: One who is proud, self-reliant, and self-righteous, will not enter the **kingdom of heaven** because he sees no need for God.(John Strohman)

5:3: One who is **poor in spirit** would speak like Paul: "For I know that nothing good dwells in me, that is, in my flesh. For I have the desire to do what is right, but not the ability to carry it out." (Rom 7:18)

5:3: Быть **нищим духом** означает иметь духовное убеждение, что мы ничего своего не имеем а имеем только то, что дарует Бог, и что ничего доброго мы не можем сделать без Божией помощи и благодати, и таким образом. должны считать, что мы - Ничто и во всем прибегать к милосердию Божию. Кратко по объяснению святого Иоанна Златоуста, нищета духовная есть смиренномудрие.
Нищета телесная может служить к совершенству нищеты духовной, если христианин избирает её добровольно для Бога. Об этом сказал Сам Господь Иисус Христос богатому; "Если хочешь быть совершенным, пойди. продай имение твое, и раздай нищим; будешь иметь сокровище на небесах и приходи, и следуй за Мной" (Мф. 19:21).
(Православный Катехизис Филаретовский)

5:3: The opposite to one **poor in spirit** would be a person who believes himself to be spiritual, having everything he needs, being capable of achieving every moral and spiritual goal himself, needing nothing and lacking nothing. The man that does not recognize his need is not going to start searching for a solution. And the solution that this man would not seek is God.

5:3: definition of *self-righteous*:
- having or characterized by a certainty, especially an unfounded one, that one is totally correct or morally superior (Google)
- being convinced that they are right in their beliefs, attitudes, and behaviour and that other people are wrong. (Collins dictionary)
- believing that your ideas and behaviour are morally better than those of other people. “He's so self-righteous - like he's never done anything wrong in his life.” (Cambridge dictionary)

5:3: Discussion demands that it be looked at from five perspectives: the meaning of **poor in spirit**, the location of this virtue in the list, the way to achieve that attitude, how to know if we have that attitude, and the result promised for having it. (MacArthur)

5:3: (<u>The Meaning of Poor in Spirit</u>). **Poor** (Gk. *ptochos*) is from a verb meaning “to shrink, cower, or cringe”, as beggars often did in that day; a word that refers to a person reduced to total destitution, who crouched in a corner begging. The term did not mean simply poor, but begging poor. As he held out one hand for alms, he often hid his face with the other hand, ashamed of being recognized.
Poor people were commonly called “*penichros*”, as the widow Jesus saw in the Temple: poor, but not a beggar. *Penichros* poor has at least some meager resources; *ptochos* poor is completely dependent on others for sustenance, with absolutely no means of self-support.
Some interpreters have maintained that v.3 teaches material poverty, but Jesus is speaking of a spiritual poverty that corresponds to the material poverty. Matthew makes clear that Jesus is talking about the condition of the **spirit**, not of the wallet.
The **poor in spirit** are those who recognize their total spiritual destitution and their complete dependence on God. They perceive that there are no saving resources in themselves and that they can only beg for mercy and grace.
(Examples: In the parable of the tax-collector and the Pharisee praying (Lk 18:9-14), the Pharisee was proud in spirit, but the tax-collector was **poor in spirit**. Paul recognized that “nothing good dwells in me, that is, in my flesh” (Rom 7:18))
The error of the Pharisees: in the name of interpreting and protecting the law, they contradicted and weakened it. They brought God’s standards down to men’s standards, which they could keep without God’s help. They made the fatal error of thinking that God was less holy than He is and that they were more holy than they were. The result was the illusion that they were sufficiently righteous to please God. But the humble and penitent still called to God for help.
(MacArthur)

5:3: (<u>Why Humility is First</u>) Jesus puts this beatitude first because humility is the foundation of all other graces, a basic element in becoming a Christian. Pride has no part in Christ’s kingdom, and until a person surrenders pride, he cannot enter the kingdom. The door into His kingdom is low, and no one who stands tall will ever go through it. We cannot be filled until we are empty; we cannot be made worthy until we recognize our unworthiness; we cannot live until we admit we are dead. We might as well expect fruit to grow without a tree as to expect the other graces of the Christian life to grow without humility.
Until a soul is humbled, until the inner person is **poor in spirit**, Christ can never become dear, because He is obscured by self. We cannot recognize His glory until we know how helpless, worthless, and sinful we are. Where self is exalted, Christ cannot be. This beatitude is first because humility must precede everything else.
(MacArthur)

5:3: (<u>Achieving Humility</u>) How do we become **poor in spirit**? Almost by definition, it cannot start with us, with anything we can do or accomplish in our own power. Humility simply starts with recognizing the truth. Humility is not human work, but a necessary divine work to make us see that we are unworthy and cannot change our condition without God. 
This is why things like monasticism, asceticism, physical self-denial, and other self-efforts are so futile: they feed pride rather than subdue it, because they give a person a reason to boast in what he has done or not done.
Even though it is the Lord Who does the work of humbling, it is never without personal cooperation. This is why there are numerous divine commands to humble oneself (Mt 18:4; 23:12; Jas 4:10; 1 Pet 5:5).
The first step in experiencing humility is to turn our eyes off ourselves and to look to God. To seek humility, we do not look at ourselves to find the faults, but at God Almighty to behold His perfection; that allows us to see ourselves as sinners by contrast. When we study His Word, seek His face in prayer, and sincerely desire to be near Him and please Him, we move toward being **poor in spirit**.
Second, we must remove and avoid those things that promote pride. Being given praise is not evil, but seeking it and glorying in it is. Third, ask God for humility: like every other good gift, it only comes from God. “Create in me a clean heart” (Ps 51:10). 
(MacArthur)

5:3: (<u>Knowing When We are Humble</u>) Thomas Watson gives 7 principles we may apply in determining humility. 1) One who is poor in spirit loses his self-preoccupation. Self is nothing, and Christ is everything. “I have been crucified with Christ; and it is no longer I who live, but Christ lives in me” (Gal 2:20). 2) Humility will lead us to be lost in the wonder of Christ. Our satisfaction will be in the prospect of one day being fully in the likeness of our Lord. 3) We will not complain about our situation, no matter how bad it may become. Because we know we deserve worse than anything we can experience in this life, we will consider no circumstance to be unfair. 4) We will more clearly see the strengths and virtues of others as well as our own weaknesses and sins. We will “regard one another as more important than [ourselves]” (Php 2:3). 5) We will spend much time in prayer. We will knock often at heaven’s gate because we are always in need. 6) We will take Christ on His terms and will not modify His standards to our own liking. His Word alone will be our standard. 7) When we are poor in spirit, we will praise and thank God for His grace. He knows that he has no blessings and no happiness but that which the Father gives.
(MacArthur)

5:3: (<u>The Result of Being Poor in Spirit</u>). Those who come to the King in this humility inherit His** kingdom of Heaven**. God has gladly chosen to give the kingdom to those who humbly come to Him and trust Him. 
In giving up their own kingdom, the poor in spirit inherit God’s.
(MacArthur) 




















#### “Blessed are those who mourn, for they shall be comforted.

5:4: “**Blessed** [forgiven, refreshed by God’s grace] are those who **mourn** [over their sins and repent], for they will be **comforted** [when the burden of sin is lifted].” (AMP)

5:4: The **mourn**ing discussed here is not self-pity but the sorrow of a repentant heart that leads to salvation. Salvation is the happiness and **comfort** given to those who mourn. See 2 Cor 7:9-11: "sorrowful to the point of repentance", "[godly] sorrow produces a repentance"  (John Strohman)

5:4: Под плачем следует понимать печаль и сокрушение сердца и действительные слезы о том, что мы несовершенно и недостойно служим Господу и заслуживаем наими грехами Его гнев. "Печаль ради Бога производит неизменное покаяние ко спасению а печаль мирская производит смерть" (2 Кор. 7:10). Господь обещает плачущим, что они утешатся: здесь понимается утешение благодатное, состоящее в прощении грехов и умиротворенней совести. Обещание утешения говорит о том, что печаль о грехах не должна доходить до отчаяния. (Православный Катехизис Филаретовский)

5:4: " If I have never **mourned** over my waywardness, then I have no solid ground for rejoicing" (Arthur Pink)

5:4: (<u>worldly definition of happiness</u>) Throughout history a basic axiom of the world has been that favorable things bring happiness, where as unfavorable things bring unhappiness. So self-evident and obvious: pleasure brings happiness, money, entertainment, fame and praise bring happiness; and avoiding pain, trouble, disappointment, frustration, hardships brings happiness. Jesus reversed the path to happiness.
The world says, hide your problems and sins and pretend to be happy. But Jesus says, confess your sins, and mourn, mourn, mourn. This is how genuine happiness will come: through mourning and forgiveness.
(MacArthur)

5:4: (<u>Improper Mourning, Proper Mourning, Godly mourning</u>) Improper **mourning** is the sorrow of those who are frustrated in fulfilling evil plans and lusts, or who have misguided loyalties and affection. To those who mourn in that way the Lord offers no help of solace. Even legitimate sorrow can be carried to illegitimate extremes: e.g. a long paralyzing grief over the loss of a loved one is essentially selfish.
Reasonable **mourning** is appropriate in some cases: it opens an escape valve that keeps our feelings from poisoning our emotions. That’s our reaction to loss, expression of concern.
But the **mourning** about which Jesus speaks has nothing to do with those types. Jesus is speaking of godly sorrow: a mourning that only those who sincerely desire to belong to Him or who already belong to Him can experience. This is the only sorrow that brings spiritual life and growth: sorrow over sin that leads to repentance: “For godly grief produces a repentance that leads to salvation without regret, whereas worldly grief produces death” (1 Cor 7:10). Godly sorrow is linked to repentance.

5:4: (<u>the logical sequence and progression of beatitudes</u>) Spiritual poverty (v. 3) leads to godly sorrow; the poor in spirit become **those who mourn**.
(MacArthur)

5:4: (<u>the meaning of **sorrow**</u>) Of the nine terms used in Greek for **sorrow**, the one used here (Gk. *Pentheo*) is the strongest, the most severe. It represents the deepest, most heart-felt grief, and was generally reserved for grieving over the death of a loved one. It carries the idea of deep inner agony, which may or may not be expressed by outward weeping, wailing, or lament.(MacArthur)

5:4: (<u>the meaning of blessedness</u>) **Blessedness**, or happiness, does not come in the mourning itself, but with what God does in response to it, with the forgiveness that such mourning brings. God’s forgiveness of human sin. 
Only mourners over sin are happy because only mourners over sin have their sins forgiven. Sin and happiness are totally incompatible: where one exists, the other cannot. Until sin is forgiven and removed, happiness is locked out. But mourning over sin brings forgiveness of sin, and forgiveness of sin brings freedom and a joy that cannot be experienced in any other way.
(MacArthur)

5:4: (<u>defective sense of humor</u>) How James explains it: “Cleanse your hands, you sinners, and purify your hearts, you double-minded. Be wretched and **mourn** and weep. Let your laughter be turned to mourning and your joy to gloom. Humble yourselves before the Lord, and he will exalt you.” (Jas 4:8-10)
There is a great need in the church today to cry instead of laugh, and start growing in the awareness of sin. We follow the sinful world vicariously, if not actually, when we laugh at the world’s crude and immoral jokes even though we do not retell them, when we are entertained by a sin even though we do not indulge in it, when we smile at ungodly talk even though we do not repeat the words. To joke about divorce, to make light of brutality, to be intrigued by sexual immorality is to rejoice when we should be mourning, to be laughing when we should be crying. 
A defective sense of sin is reflected in a defective sense of humor. The way to happiness is not in making light of sin, but rather in sorrow over it that cries to God.
(MacArthur)

5:4: (<u>continuity</u>) **Those who mourn** (Gk. *Penthountes*) is a present participle, indicating continuous action,
The faithful child of God is constantly broken over his sinfulness. To grow in grace is also to grow in awareness of sin. The mark of the mature life is not sinlessness, which is reserved for heaven, but growing awareness of sinfulness. The subjects of God’s Kingdom are characterized by continual confession of sin.
(MacArthur)

5:4: (<u>vs. despair</u>) **Mourning** over sin is not being engulfed in despair. True mourning over sin does not focus on ourselves either, not even on our sin; but it focuses on God, Who alone can forgive and remove our sin. (MacArthur)

5:4: (<u>the result of mourning</u>) It is not the **mourning** that **blesses**, but the **comfort** God gives to those who mourn in a godly way. The blessing of God’s comfort is reserved exclusively for the contrite of heart (**they** (Gk. *autos*) indicates that it applies *only* to such mourners). It is only those who mourn for sin who will have their tears wiped away by the loving hand of Jesus Christ.
(MacArthur)

5:4: **Comfort **(Gk. *parakaleo*) is the same word that, as a noun, is rendered Comforter (or Helper) in Jn 14:16: *Parakletos*. (MacArthur)

5:4: **Shall be** does not refer to the end of the age, but to the immediate future that follows mourning. It is a blessing that comes after obedience. The comfort comes after mourning. (MacArthur)

5:4: (<u>What does true mourning over sin involve</u>) The first step requires removing the hindrances that keep us from mourning: the things that make us content with ourselves, that make us resist God’s Spirit and question His Word, and that harden our hearts.
*Love of sin* is the primary hindrance of mourning: holding on to sin will freeze and petrify a heart. A stony heart does not mourn.
*Despair* hinders mourning because it gives up on God, refusing to believe that He can save and help. Despair puts ourselves outside God’s grace. The one who despairs believes he is destined to sin. Because he believes God has given up on him, he gives up on God.
*Conceit* is a hindrance because it tries to hide the sin itself, choosing to believe that there is nothing over which to mourn. It is comparable to a doctor treating cancer as if it were a cold. If it was necessary for Jesus Christ to shed His blood on the cross to save us from our sin, our sin must be great indeed!
*Presumption* hinders mourning because it is really a form of pride. It recognizes the need for grace, but is satisfied with cheap grace, and sees sin as not bad enough to be confessed, repented of, and forsaken. 
*Procrastination* hinders godly mourning simply by putting it off until the right day, state, or circumstance. But it is foolish and dangerous because we “do not know what [our] life will be like tomorrow” (Jas 4:14). It sin is not dealt with, we have no assurance that comfort will ever come, because we have no assurance we will have time to confess it later.
The most important step we can take in getting rid of hindrances to mourning, whatever they are, is to look at the holiness of God and the great sacrifice of sin-bearing at the cross. If seeing Christ die for our sins does not thaw a cold heart or break up a hardened hard, it is beyond melting or breaking.
The second step is to study sin in Scripture, to learn what an evil and repulsive thing it is to God and what a destructive and damning thing it is to us. Sin tramples on God’s laws, makes light of His love, grieves His Spirit, spurns His forgiveness and blessing, and in every way resists His grace.
The third step toward godly mourning is to pray for contriteness of heart, which only God can give and which He never refuses to give to those who ask. It must always be recognized that humility depends on the working of the Lord.
(MacArthur)

5:4: (<u>How to know if we are mourning as Christ commands</u>) First, we need to ask ourselves if we are sensitive to sin. If we laugh at it, take it lightly, or enjoy it, we can be sure we are not mourning over it and are outside the sphere of God’s blessing
The mock righteousness of hypocrites who make every effort to appear holy on the outside (Mt 6:1-18) has no sensititity to sin, only sensitivity to personal prestige and reputation. Nor does the mock gratitude of those who thank God they are better than other people (Lk 18:11)..
The godly mourner will have true sorrow for his sins. His first concern is for the harm his sin does to God’s glory, not the harm its exposure might bring to his own reputation or welfare.
If our mourning is godly, we will grieve for the sins of fellow believers and for the sins of the world. We will look out over the community where we live and weep, as Jesus looked out over Jerusalem and wept.
The second way to determine if we have genuine mourning over sin is to check our sense of God’s forgiveness. Have we experienced the release and freedom of knowing our sins are forgiven? Do we have His peace and joy in our life? Can we point to true happiness He has given in response to our mourning? Do we have the divine comfort He promises to those who have forgiven, cleansed, and purified lives?
(MacArthur)




















#### “Blessed are the meek, for they shall inherit the earth.

5:5: Not the powerful, but the **gentle** will **inherit the earth**. Meekness and gentleness do not mean weakness and powerlessness. On the contrary, gentleness is *great power under control*. (John Strohman)

5:5: **Кротость** — тихое состояние духа, соединённое с осторожностью никого не раздражать и ничем не раздражаться. В особенности, не роптать не только на Бога, но и на людей, и когда происходит что-то против наших желаний, не предаваться гневу, не превозноситься. Обещание **наследовать землю** исполнилось буквально: постоянно короткие христиане вместо того, чтобы быть истреблёнными яростью язычников, наследовали вселенную, которой прежде обладали язычники. (Православный Катехизис Филаретовский)

5:5: **Кротость** -- это всегда проявление отношения к кому-то. **Кростость** -- это нежное отношение друг к другу. (Лунёв)

5:5: (<u>shocking to hearers</u>) Like the first two beatitudes, his one must have been shocking and perplexing to head. All Jews hoped for deliverance from Roman rule. The Pharisees expected the Messiah to come with great fanfare and a mighty show of power. Sadducees hoped for a change through political compromise. The Zealots expected the Messiah to come as a powerful, irresistible military leader who would conquer Rome. The idea of a **meek** Messiah leading meek people was far from any of their concepts of the messianic kingdom. The people as a whole eventually rejected Jesus because He did not fulfill their messianic expectations. How could a Messiah who taught for a few years, accomplished absolutely nothing as far as anyone could see, and then was rejected by the religious teachers and put to death, be worth believing in? (MacArthur)

5:5: (<u>The meaning of meekness</u>) **Gentle **(Gk. *praos*) means mild or soft. Was much used to refer to tame animals whose wild spirits were broken by a trainer so that they could do useful work. As a human attitude, it meant being gentle of spirit, meek, submissive, quiet, tenderhearted. 
**Meekness** does not connote weakness. Meekness means power put under control. (Prov 16:32: “Whoever is slow to anger is better than the mighty, and he who rules his spirit than he who takes a city“). An unbroken wild animal is useless; medicine that is too strong kills; emotion out of control destroys, and has no place in God’s kingdom.
**Meekness** is the opposite of violence and vengeance. The meek person has died to self, and he therefore does not worry about injury to himself, or about loss, insult, or abuse. The meek person does not defend himself and does not stand up for his rights: he stands humbly before God, knowing he has nothing to commend himself. 
Meekness is not lack of conviction nor mere human niceness, but its courage, its strength, its conviction, and its pleasantness come from God, not from self. Meekness is not weakness, but it does not use its power for its own defense or selfish purposes. Meekness is power completely surrendered to God’s control.
The spirit of meekness is the spirit of Christ, who, being the only human being who did no wrong, never defended Himself. He was zealous about the purity of His Father’s house (Jn 2:14-15: the cleansing of the Temple), but Jesus did not once raise a finger or give a single retort in HIs own defense.
(MacArthur)

5:5: (<u>vs. poverty in spirit</u>) Poverty in spirit focuses on our sinfulness, whereas meekness focuses on God’s holiness. Humility underlies both virtues: when we look honestly at ourselves, we are made humble by seeing how sinful and unworthy we are; when we look at God, we are made humble by seeing how righteous and worthy He is. (MacArthur)

5:5: (<u>logical sequence and progression of Beatitudes</u>) Logical progression: being poor in spirit causes us to turn away from ourselves in mourning (negative), and **meekness** causes us to turn toward God in seeking His righteousness (positive). 
The blessings of the Beatitudes are for those who are realistic about their sinfulness, who are repentant of their sins, and who are responsive to God in His righteousness. Those who are unblessed, unhappy, and shut out of the kingdom are the proud, the arrogant, the unrepentant — the self-sufficient and self-righteous who see in themselves no unworthiness and feel no need for God’s help and God’s righteousness. (MacArthur)

5:5: (<u>self-righteous</u>) Most of Jesus’ hearers, like fallen men throughout history, were concerned about justifying their own ways, defending their own rights, and serving their own ends. The way of **meekness** was not their way, and therefore the true kingdom was not their kingdom. (MacArthur)

5:5: (<u>the result of meekness</u>) The general result is being **blessed**: being made divinely happy. God gives the meek His own joy and gladness.
More specifically, however, they **will inherit the earth**. When God reclaims His earthly domain, those who have become His children through faith in His Son will rule that domain with Him.
The word **inherit** (kleronomeo) refers to the receiving of one’s allotted portion, one’s rightful inheritance.
(MacArthur)

5:5: (<u>the necessity for meekness</u>) The emphatic pronoun **they** (Gk. *autos*)  is again used, indicating that *only* those who are meek **shall inherit the earth**. Meekness is therefore necessary for salvation (Ps 149:4: “He crowns the humble with salvation”). 
“Unless you .. become like children, you shall not enter the kingdom of heaven. Whoever humbles himself as this child, he is the greatest in the kingdom of heaven” (Mt 18:2-4). 
“In humility we receive the word implanted, which is able to save your soul” (Jas 1:21). Without humility one can’t listen rightly to God’s word, much less understand and receive it.
“...always being ready to make a defense to everyone ho asks … yet with gentleness” (1 Pet 3:15). Without meekness, we cannot witness effectively: pride will always stand between our testimony and those to whom we testify. They will see us instead of the Lord, no matter how orthodox our theology or how refined our technique. Meekness is necessary because only meekness gives glory to God. Pride seeks its own glory, but meekness seeks God’s.
(MacArthur)

5:5: (<u>the unrighteous</u>) “the unrighteous shall not inherit the kingdom of God” (1 Cor 6:9). The wicked and godless seem to prosper today, but that is for a time; God assured His people that “ In just a little while, the wicked will be no more; though you look carefully at his place, he will not be there. But the meek shall inherit the land and delight themselves in abundant peace.“ (Ps 37:10-11). Our responsibility is to trust the Lord and obey His will; and exactly in the right time and in the right way, He will settle the accounts. (MacArthur)




















#### “Blessed are those who hunger and thirst for righteousness, for they shall be satisfied.

5:6: **Hunger** and **thirst** are basics of our physical needs. **Righteousness** is the basic in the spiritual life. Just as we have a driving passion to eat or drink, we are to have a driving passion to live righteously to the glory of God. Growing in righteousness is called **sanctification**. (John Strohman)

5:6: **Алчущие и жаждущие правды** - это те, кто делают добро, но не считают себя праведниками, не полагаясь на свои добрые дела, признают себя грешными и виновными перед Богом, алчут и жаждут благодатного оправдания через Иисуса Христа. Господь обещал, что они **насытятся**. Подобно телесному насыщению которое приносит во-первых, прекращение чувства голода и жажды, а во-вторых подкрепление тела пищей - духовное насыщение означает: внутреннее успокоение помилованного грешника приобретение силы для делания добра. (Православный Катехизис Филаретовский)

5:6: **Hunger and thirst** speak of strong desire, of driving pursuit, of a passionate force inside the soul. A starving person has a single, all-consuming passion for food and water. Nothing else has the slightest attraction or appeal; nothing else can even get his attention. This is the kind of hunger and thirst of which Jesus speaks in this beatitude. And Jesus’ using the present participle signifies continuous longing, continuous seeking.
Jesus declares that the deepest desire of every person ought to be **to hunger and thirst for righteousness**, and therein lies the way to being truly **blessed**. This holy ambition contrasts with the common ambitions of men to gratify their own lusts, accomplish their own goals, and satisfy their own egos. (MacArthur)

5:6: To be **hungry** is not enough; I must be really starving to know what is in God’s heart toward me. When the prodigal son was hungry, he went to feed on the husks, but when he was starving, he turned to his father. (John Darby)

5:6: (<u>the necessity for spiritual hunger</u>) **Hunger and thirst** represent the necessities of physical life. Jesus’ analogy demonstrates that **righteousness** is required for spiritual life just as food and water are required for physical life. **Righteousness** is not an optional spiritual supplement but a spiritual necessity. We can no more live spiritually without righteousness than we can live physically without food and water.
Seeking satisfaction not in the things of the world but only in God and in His provision is a mark of those who come into His kingdom. They desire sin to be replaced with virtue and disobedience to be replaced by obedience They are eager to serve the Word and will of God.
The person who has no hunger and thirst for righteousness has no part in God’s kingdom. To have God’s life within us through the new birth in Jesus Christ is to desire more of His likeness within us by growing in righteousness. The true believer desires to obey, even though he struggles with unredeemed flesh.
(MacArthur)

5:6: (<u>logical sequence and progression of beatitudes</u>) Becoming poor in spirit involves death to self. Mourning over sin involves facing up to our sinfulness. Becoming meek involves surrendering our power to God’s control. The fourth beatitude is more positive and is a consequence of the other three. When we put aside self, sins, and power, and turn to the Lord, we are given a great desire for righteousness. The more we put away what we have, the more we long for what God has.
When a person abandons all hope of saving himself, all confidence in self-righteousness, and begins to hunger for the salvation that brings God’s righteousness and the obedience that God requires, he will be **blessed**, be made divinely happy.
(MacArthur)

5:6: (<u>the specific righteousness, and all or it</u>) When speaking about **hunger in thirst**, Greeks would normally use the *partitive genitive*: a case than indicates partialness, i.e. “some food” or “some water”. But Jesus uses the accusative, and therefore, **righteousness** is unqualified and unlimited. The Lord identifies those who desire all the righteousness there is.
No believer ever “arrives” to righteousness in his spiritual life until he reaches heaven. Children of the kingdom never stop needing or hungering for more of God’s righteousness and holiness to be manifest in them through obedience. We cannot possibly have our longing for godliness satisfied in this life, so we are left to continually hunger and thirst until the day we are clothed entirely in Christ’s righteousness.
Jesus also uses the definite article (*ten*), indicating that He is not speaking of just any righteousness, but **the**** righteousness**, the only true righteousness — that which comes from God and, in fact, is God’s very own righteousness which He has in Himself. 
(MacArthur)

5:6: (<u>the result of spiritual hunger</u>) The result is being **satisfied**. Feeding until being full. Jesus’ divine pronouncement is that those who hunger and thirst for righteousness will be given total satisfaction. The giving of satisfaction si God’s work, as the future passive tense indicates: **they will be satisfied**. Our part is to seek; His part is to satisfy.
Jesus satisfies with a water drinking which a person would never thirst (Jn 4:14, woman at the well), and with a bread, eating which a person shall not hunger (Jn 6:35, the feeding of the 5000).
(MacArthur)

5:6: (<u>the testing of spiritual hunger</u>) There are several marks of genuine hunger and thirst for God’s righteousness. 1) Dissatisfaction with self. One who is pleased with his own righteousness will see no need for God’s. 2) Freedom from dependence on external things for satisfaction. Nothing but God’s own righteousness can satisfy the person who has true spiritual hunger and thirst. 3) Craving for the Word of God, the basic spiritual food He provides His children. The more we seek God’s righteousness, the more we will want to devour Scripture. 4) The pleasantness of the things of God. Even the Lord’s reproofs and discipline bring satisfaction, because they are signs of our Father’s love. 5) Genuine hunger is unconditional and will seek and accept God’s righteousness in whatever way He chooses to provide it, and will obey His commands no matter how demanding they may be. The least of God’s righteousness is more valuable than the greatest of anything we possess in ourselves or that the world can offer. 
(MacArthur)




















#### “Blessed are the merciful, for they shall receive mercy.

5:7: Those who show **mercy** by the spirit of God, will be shown **mercy** by God. (John Strohman)

5:7: Дела **милости** телесные следующие: накормить голодного; напоить жаждущего; одеть нагого (имеющего недостаток в необходимой и приличной одежде); посетить находящегося в темнице; посетить больного, послужить ему и помочь его выздоровлению или христианскому приготовлению к смерти; странника принять в дом и предоставить отдых; погребать умерших в бедности и нищете. 
Дела **милости** духовные таковы: увещанием обратить грешника от ложного пути его (Иак. 5:20); незнающего научить истине и добру; ближнему дать добрый и благовременный совет в затруднении или в случае не замечаемой им опасности; молиться о ближнем Богу; утешить печального; не воздавать за зло, сделанное нам другими; всем сердцем прощать обиды. 
Господь обещает я что поступающие так **помилованы** будут: помилованы от вечного осуждения за грехи на суде Божием. (Православный Катехизис Филаретовский)

5:7-10: (<u>the logical sequence and progression of beatitudes</u>) The last four beatitudes are outward manifestations of the principles of heart and mind described in the first four. Those who in poverty of spirit recognize their need of **mercy** are led to show **mercy** to others. Those who mourn over their sin are led to purity of heart. Those who are meek always seek to make peace. And those who hunger and thirst for righteousness are never unwilling to pay the price of being persecuted for righteousness’ sake. (MacArthur)

5:7: (<u>worldly reciprocal mercy</u>) For the most part, the days in which Jesus lived and taught were not characterized by **mercy**. The Jewish religionists themselves were not inclined to show mercy because mercy is not a characteristic of those who are proud, self-righteous, and judgmental. To many, perhaps — most, of Jesus’ hearers, mercy was considered one of the least of virtues. It was in the same category as love: reserved for those who had shown the virtue to you. You loved those who loved you, and you showed mercy to those who showed mercy to you. (Mt 5:43: “You have heard that it was said, ‘You shall love your neighbor and hate your enemy.”). But such a shallow, selfish kind of love that even the outcast tax-gatherers practiced was not acceptable to the Savior (Mt 5:46: “For if you love those who love you, what reward do you have? Do not even the tax collectors do the same?”). 
Other people see this beatitude in another way that is just as selfish and humanistic: mercy given will mean mercy received. For such people, mercy is shown to others purely in an effort toward self-seeking.
The underlying motive of self-concern has characterized men since the Fall. We see it expressed today in such sayings as “If you don’t look out for yourself, no one else will.” Such popular proverbs are generally true, because they reflect the basic selfish nature of fallen man. Men are not naturally inclined to show mercy.
(MacArthur)

5:7: (<u>the power of the father in Roman culture</u>) During much of Roman history, a father had the right of *patria opitestas*, of deciding whether or not his newborn child would live or die. As the infant was held up for him to see, the father would turn his thumb up if he wanted the child to live, down if he wanted it to die. If this thumb turned down, the child was immediately drowned. Citizens had the same life-or-death power over slaves. At any time and for any reason they could kill and bury a slave, with no fear of arrest or reprisal. Husbands could even have their wives put to death on the least provocation. (MacArthur)
In practice, the extreme form of the father’s right was seldom exercised. It was eventually limited by law. (Wikipedia)

5:7: The fifth beatitude does not teach that **mercy** to men brings mercy from men, but that mercy to men brings mercy from God. God will be merciful to use, whether men are or are not. God is the subject of the second clause, just as in the other beatitudes.         (MacArthur)

5:7: (<u>the meaning of mercy</u>) **Merciful** (Gk. *eleēmones*): beneficial, charitable. The basic meaning is to give help to the afflicted and to rescue the helpless. It is compassion in action.
Jesus is not speaking of detached or powerless sentiment, nor is He speaking of feigned pity that gives help only to a guilty conscience or to impress others with its appearance of virtue. And it is not passive, silent concern which, though genuine, is unable to give tangible help. 
It is not simply feeling compassion, but showing compassion. **Mercy** is genuine compassion expressed in genuine help, selfless concern expressed in selfless deeds.

5:7: (<u>mercy, forgiveness, love</u>)
**Mercy** has much in common wit forgiveness. Forgiveness flows out of mercy, and mercy flows out of love. Mercy is more than forgiveness; and love is more than mercy, because it manifests itself in many ways that do not involve either forgiveness or mercy: love loves even when there is no wrong to forgive or need to meet.
Mercy is the physician; love is the friend. Mercy acts because of need; love acts because of affection, whether there is need or not. Mercy is reserved for times of trouble; love is constant. There can be no true mercy apart from love, but there can be true love apart from mercy.
(MacArthur)

5:7: (<u>mercy, grace</u>) **Mercy** is also related to grace. In each of his three pastoral epistles Paul includes the words “grace, mercy and peace” in his salutations (1 Tim 1:2; 2 TIm 1:2; Titus 1:4). Mercy is closely related with grace, yet they are different. Mercy has to do with pain, misery, and distress: the consequences of sin. Grace, on the other hand, deals with sin itself. Mercy deals with the symptoms, grace with the cause. Mercy offers relief from punishment; grace offers pardon for the crime. Mercy eliminates the pain; grace cures the disease. Mercy relates to the negative; grace relates to the positive.
When the Good Samaritan bound up the wounds of the man, he showed mercy. When he paid for his lodging, he showed grace.
(MacArthur)

5:7: (<u>mercy, justice</u>) God’s **mercy** does not ignore sin: God does not show **mercy** without punishing sin; and for Him to offer mercy without punishment would negate His justice.
Mercy that ignores sin is false mercy: wickedness has to be dealt with, otherwise, the warm attitude will reinforce it (as was the case with David’s son Absalom). 
That sort of false mercy is common in our day. It is thought to be unloving and unkind to hold people responsible for their sins. But that is a cheap grace that is not just and is not merciful. Because if overlooks sin, it leaves sin, and the one who relies on that sort of mercy is left in his sin. To cancel justice is to cancel mercy: these two are met together.
(MacArthur)

5:7: (<u>the price of mercy</u>) In every true act of **mercy**, someone pays the price. To be merciful is to bear the load for someone else. The Good Samaritan did pay the price. And God’s mercy is not grounded in sentiment but in Christ’s atoning blood which paid the penalty for and cleanses from sin those who believe in Him. The good news of the Gospel is not that God winked at justice, glossed over sin, and compromised righteousness; the good news is that in the shedding of Christ’s blood justice was satisfied, sin was forgiven, righteousness was fulfilled, and mercy was made available. There is never an excuse for sin, but always a remedy. (MacArthur)  

5:7: **Mercy**, therefore, is one than forgiveness and less than love. It is different from grace and is one with justice. And what is true of God’s mercy should be true of ours. (MacArthur)

5:7: (<u>mercy is giving</u>) In the midst of our corrupt, ego-centered, and selfish society that tells us to grab everything we can get, the voice of God tells us to give everything we can give. The true character of **mercy** is in giving: giving compassion, giving help, giving time, giving forgiveness, giving money, giving ourselves. 
The children of the King are merciful. Those who are merciless face judgment: “for judgement will be merciless to one who has shown no mercy”; but  “mercy triumphs over judgment” (Jas 2:13).
(MacArthur)

5:7: (<u>the source of mercy</u>) We can be **merciful** only when we have experienced God’s mercy. Mercy is only for those who through grace and divine power bow humbly before God in poverty of spirit, who mourn over and turn from their sin, who are meek and submissive to His control, and who hunger and thirst above all else for His righteousness. They way of mercy is the way of humility, repentance, surrender, and holiness. (MacArthur)

5:7: (<u>showing spiritual mercy</u>) **Mercy** is also to be shown spiritually. 
First, **mercy** is shown through pity. Augustine said: “If I weep for the body from which the soul is departed, should I not weep for the soul from which God is departed?” The sensitive Christian will grieve more for lost souls that for lost bodies. Because we have experienced God’s mercy, we are to have great concern for those who have not.
Examples: Jesus’s mercy for His executioners (Lk 23:34: “Father, forgive them, for they know not what they do”). Stephen prayed for those who were taking his life (Ac 7:60: “Lord, do not hold this sin against them.”). 
Second, we are to show spiritual **mercy** by confrontation. Paul says we should “correct his opponents with gentleness. God may perhaps grant them repentance leading to a knowledge of the truth” (2 Tim 2:25). We are to be willing to confront others about their sin in order that they might come to God for salvation. Love and mercy will be severe when that is necessary for the sake of an erring brother. In such cases it is cruel to say nothing and let the harm continue.
Third, we are to show spiritual **mercy** by praying. The sacrifice of prayer for those without God is an act of mercy. Our mercy can be measured by out prayer for the unsaved and for Christians who are walking in disobedience.
Fourth, we are to show spiritual **mercy** by proclaiming the saving gospel of Jesus Christ — the most merciful thing we can do. 
(MacArthur)

5:7: (<u>the result of mercy</u>) We see God’s cycle of **mercy**: God is merciful to us by saving us through Christ; in obedience, we are merciful to others; and God, in faithfulness, gives us even more mercy, pouring out blessing for our needs and withholding severe chastening for our sin. 
As in other beatitudes, the emphatic pronoun *autos* (**they**) indicates that *only* those who are merciful qualify to **receive mercy** from God. But “judgment will be merciless to one who has shown no mercy” (Jas 2:13). “But if you do not forgive men, they your Father will not forgive your transgressions” (Mt 6:14-15).
We do not earn salvation by being merciful. We must be saved by God’s mercy before we can truly *be* merciful.




















#### “Blessed are the pure in heart, for they shall see God.

5:8: “**Blessed** [anticipating God’s presence, spiritually mature] are the **pure in heart** [those with integrity, moral courage, and godly character], for they will see God.” (AMP)

5:8: A **pure heart** cannot come from the unsaved man. A pure heart cannot love both God and things of this world (John Strohman)

5:8: **Purity of heart** is to will one thing. (Kierkegaard)

5:8:  **Чистота сердца** не есть чистосердечие. Чистосердечие (искренность) — когда человек не демонстрирует свои добрые расположения, которых в действительности нет в его сердце, а имеющиеся добрые расположения со скромностью воплощает в делах —  есть только начальная степень чистоты сердца. Подлинная чистота сердца достигается постоянным и неослабным подвигом бдения над самим собой, изгнанием из сердца всякого незаконного желания и помышления, пристрастия к земным предметам, с верой и любовью непрестанно храня в нём память о Господе Боге Иисусе Христе. (Православный Катехизис Филаретовский)

5:8: (<u>the meaning</u>) **Blessed** implies the condition of well-being that results from salvation, the status of one who has a right relation to God. Being accepted by Him is a matter of internal transformation.
**Heart** is universally used metaphorically to represent the inner person, the seat of motives and attitudes, the center of personality. In Scripture it represents much more than emotion, feelings: it also includes the thinking process and particularly the will. The heart is the control center of mind and will as well as emotion. 
**Pure** translates *katharos*, a form of the word from which we get *catharsis* (cleansing of the mind or emotions). The basic meaning is to make pure by cleansing from dirt, filth, and contamination. The Greek word is related to the Latin *catus* (morally pure, guiltless, pure, chaste, pious), from which we get *chaste*. The related word chasten refers to discipline given in order to cleanse from wrong behavior.
The Greek term was often used of metals that had been refined until all impurities were removed, leaving only pure metal. In that sense, purity means unmixed, unalloyed, unadulterated. Applied to the heart, the idea is that of pure motive: of single-mindedness, undivided devotion, spiritual integrity, and true righteousness. 

5:8: (<u>double-mindedness</u>) Purity means single-mindedness. Double-mindedness has always been one of the great plagues of the church. We want to serve the Lord and follow the world at the same time; but that is impossible (Mt 6:24: “no one can serve two masters”; Jas 4:4: “Do you not know that friendship with the world is enmity with God?”). James gives the solution to the problem in Jas 4:8: “Draw near to God, and he will draw near to you. Cleanse your hands, you sinners, and purify your hearts, you double-minded.”. (MacArthur)

5:8: (<u>outward religion vs matters of the heart</u>) In contrast to the outward and hypocritical religion of the scribes and Pharisees, Jesus said that it is in the inner man, in the core of his very being, that God requires **purity**. That was not a new truth, but an old one long forgotten amidst ceremony and tradition (Prov 4:23: “Keep your heart with all vigilance”; Gen 6:5: God destroyed the earth in the flood because of a human heart: “every intent of the thoughts of [man’s] heart was only evil continually”).
(MacArthur)

5:8: (<u>purity of heart vs. sincerity</u>) **Purity of heart **is more than sincerity. A motive can be sincere, yet lead to worthless and sinful things: a sincere devotion to a spirit or a shrine may be sincerely wrong and completely worthless before God. Even genuinely good deeds that do not come from a genuinely good heart are of no spiritual value. We cannot please God unless our hearts are right with Him.
The ultimate standard for purity of heart is perfection of heart. And those who truly belong to God will be motivated by purity.
(MacArthur)

5:8: (<u>men’s judgment of themselves vs God’s standard</u>) Men are inclined to judge ourselves by the worst instead of best. We are all tempted to feel better about ourselves when we see someone doing a terrible thing that we have never done. The “good” person looks down on the one who seems to be less good than himself, and that person looks down on those worse than he is. In the end, the world judges itself by the worst and most rotten people on earth.
God’s standard for men, however, is Himself. Only those who are pure as He is pure may enter the kingdom. It is impurity of heart that separates man from God (Is 59:2: “but your iniquities have made a separation between you and your God, and your sins have hidden his face from you so that he does not hear.”). And just as impurity of heart separates men from God, only purity of heart through Jesus Christ will reconcile men to God. (MacArthur)

5:8: (<u>head religion, hand religion, and heart religion</u>) Basically, there are but two kinds of religion: the religion of human achievement and the religion of divine accomplishment. Within the religions of human accomplishment are two basic approaches: head religion, which trusts in creeds and religious knowledge, and hand religion, which trusts in good deeds. There are many variations of the first kind, which includes every religion but biblical Christianity. 
The only true religion, however, is heart religion, which is based on God’s implanted purity by faith in what God has done through His Son. When God imputes His righteousness to us He imputes His purity to us.
(MacArthur)

5:8: (<u>six kinds of purity</u>) In Scripture, we discover six kinds of purity. 
1) *primal purity*: the kind that exists only in God. That purity is essential to God as light is to the sun or wetness is to water. 
2) *created purity*: the purity that existed in God’s creation before it was corrupted by the Fall. 
3) *positional purity*: the purity we are given the moment we trust in Jesus Christ. When we trust in Him, God imputes to use Christ’s own purity, Christ’s own righteousness. 
4) with imputed purity, *actual purity* is granted to us by God in the new nature of the believer (Rom 6:4: “newness of life”; Col 3:9-10: “put off the old self, … have put on the new self”). 
5) *practical purity* is the hard part that *does* require our supreme effort. This is why Paul implores us to “cleanse ourselves from all defilement, perfecting holiness” (2 Cor 7:1). We are not just saved for future heavenly purity, but also for present earthly purity. God wants us to be as pure as we can be, even though at best it will be gold mixed with clay, a spotted white garment. If purity does not characterize our living, we either do not belong to Christ, or we are disobedient to Him. We will have temptations, but God will always provide a way of escape (1 Cor 10:13). We will fall into sin, but “if we confess our sins, He .. will forgive and cleanse us” (1 John 1:9). 
6) Finally, we will experience *ultimate purity*, the perfected purity that God’s redeemed people will experience when they are glorified in His presence. 
(MacArthur)

5:8: (<u>the way to holiness</u>) Throughout the history of the church people tried to achieve spiritual purity through monasticism (getting away) or through seeing it as a second work of grace, a given spiritual gift. Neither Scripture nor experience supports either of those views.
God always provides for what He demands, and He has provided ways for us to live purely. 1) we must realize that we are unable to live a single holy moment without the Lord’s guidance and power. We cannot cleanse ourselves (Prov 20:9: “Who can say, “I have made my heart pure;I am clean from my sin”?“; Jer 13:23: “Can the Ethiopian change his skin or the leopard his spots? Then also you can do good who are accustomed to do evil.“). 2) we must stay in God’s Word. It is impossible to say in God’s will apart from His Word. 3) It is essential to be controlled by and walking in the will and way of the Holy Spirit (Gal 5:16: “walk by the Spirit, and you will not gratify the desires of the flesh.”). 4) We must pray. We cannot stay in God’s will or understand and obey His word unless we stay near Him. Eph 6:18: “with all prayer and petition… pray at all times in the Spirit”. 

5:8: (<u>the logical sequence and progression of beatitudes</u>) At first glance this beatitude seems out of place, but it actually is the climax of the Beatitudes, the central truth to which the previous five lead and from which the following two flow.
(MacArthur)

5:8: (<u>the result of holiness</u>) The great **blessing** of those who are pure in heart is that **they shall see God**. The Greek literally says “they shall be continuously seeing God for themselves”, **they** and *only* **they** (the emphatic *autos*). Intimate knowledge of and fellowship with God is reserved for the pure. 
When our hearts are purified at salvation we begin to live in the presence of God. We begin to see and to comprehend Him with our new spiritual eyes. Purity of heart cleanses the eyes of the sould so that God becomes visible. 
One sign of an impure heart is ignorance, because sin obscures the truth. Other signs of an impure heart are self-centeredness, pleasure in sin, unbelief, and hatred of purity. Those who belong to God exchange all of those things for integrity and purity.
(MacArthur)




















#### “Blessed are the peacemakers, for they shall be called sons of God.

5:9: **be called the sons of God**: express his character (AMP)

5:9: Быть **миротворцем** означает поступать дружелюбно и не подавать повода к разногласию; возникшее разногласие прекращать всеми средствами, даже поступаясь своими интересами, если только это не противоречит долгу и никому не вредит; стараться примирять между собой враждующих, а если такой возможности нет, то молить Бога об их примирении. (Православный Катехизис Филаретовский)

5:9: (<u>Peace in the heart</u>) **Peace** is one of the dominant ideas of God’s Word. Although the peace of earth in the garden was interrupted when man sinned, at the cross Jesus Chrsit made peace a reality again, and He becomes the peace of all who place their faith in Him. Peace can now reign in the hearts of those who are His. It is the inner personal peace that only God can give to the soul of man and that only His children can exemplify. (MacArthur) 

5:9: (<u>The modern situation concerning peace</u>) The scarcity of **peace** has prompted someone to suggest that “**peace** is that glorious moment in history when everyone stops to reload”. Our world is not characterized by peace: since 1945 there have been some 70 or so wars and nearly 200 internationally significant outbreaks of violence. We do not have economic peace, religious peace, racial peace, social peace, family peace, or personal peace.
Nor does the world honor peace: our heroes are powerful and often destructive, the model man is not meek but macho, the model hero is not self-giving but self-seeking, not generous but selfish, not gentle but cruel, not submissive but aggressive, not meek but proud. 
The popular philosophy of the world is to put self first; but when self is first, peace is last. Self precipitates strife, division, hatred, resentment and war. It is the great ally of sin and the great enemy of righteousness and, consequently, of peace.
(MacArthur)

5:9: (<u>God’s peace is unlike world’s peace</u>) This seventh beatitude calls God’s people to be **peacemakers**. He has called us to a special mission to help restore the peace lost at the Fall. This peace of which Christ speaks is unlike that which the world knows and strives for: it has nothing to do with politics, compromise, negotiations or treaties. 
God’s peace never evades issues; it knows nothing of peace at any price, it does not gloss or hide, rationalize or excuse. It confronts problems and seeks to solve them, and after the problems are solved, it builds a bridge between those who were separated by the problems. It often brings its own struggle, pain, hardship, and anguish, because such are often the price of healing. (MacArthur)

5:9: (<u>the meaning of peace</u>) The essential fact to comprehend is that the **peace** about which Jesus speaks is more than the absence of conflict and strife; it is the presence of righteousness. Only righteousness can produce the relationship that brings two parties together. Men can stop fighting without righteousness, but they cannot live peaceably without righteousness. Until disagreements and hatreds are resolved, truce is seldom more than a cold war: the conflicts merely go underground where they tend to fester, grow, and break out again. Righteousness not only puts an end to harm, but it administers the healing of love, it brings harmony and true well-being. God’s peace not only stops the hostilities but settles the issues and brings the parties together in mutual love and harmony.
The Jewish greeting *shalom* wishes “**peace**”, wishes all the righteousness and goodness God can give. The deepest meaning of *shalom* is “God’s highest good to you”.
James confirms the nature of this God’s **peace**: “But the wisdom from above is first pure, then peaceable” (Jas 3:17). God’s way to peace is through purity. Peace cannot be obtained at the expense of righteousness. Two people cannot be at peace unless they recognize and resolve the wrong attitudes and actions that caused the conflict between them, and then bring themselves to God for cleansing. Peace that ignores the cleansing is not God’s peace. Peace cannot be divorced from holiness.
The person who is not willing to disrupt and disturb in God’s name cannot be a **peacemaker**. To come to terms on anything less than God’s truth and righteousness is to settle for a truce — which confirms sinners in their sin and may leave them even further from the kingdom. Being a peacemaker is essentially the result of a holy life and the call to others to embrace the gospel of holiness.
(MacArthur)

5:9: перевод (значение мира) Важно понимать, что мир, о котором говорит Иисус, это не просто отсутствие конфликта, а присутствие праведности. Только праведность может создать между людьми такие отношения, которые их по-настоящему сблизят. Пока споры и неприязнь не будут разрешены, люди смогут лишь прийти к перемирию, который окажется не более, чем холодной войной: все конфликты просто временно уйдут в подполье, где они дозреют, подрастут, и снова вырвутся. Праведность же не только может положить конец любой вражде, но и исцелять любовью, приносить гармонию и благосостояние. Божий мир не только прекращает вражду, но и утрясает все проблемы, сближая людей в любви друг к другу.
Иаков подтверждает в своём послании, 3:17, что Божий мир приходит через чистоту: "Но мудрость, сходящая свыше, во‐первых, чиста, потом мирна". Мир приходит через чистоту, то есть, праведность. При этом, никакой мир не может быть достигнут в ущерб праведности: двое не смогут по-настоящему примириться, пока они не увидят и не разрешат все ложные взгляды и вредоносные поступки которые привели к конфликту между ними, и пока не принесут самих себя к Господу для очищения. Перемирие, в котором не признаётся необходимость очищения - не от Бога перемирие. Настоящий мир не может быть отделён от праведности.
При этом, человек, не желающий возмущать и подрывать во имя Бога не может быть миротворцем (!). Поступиться Божьей правдой и праведностью - значит, довольствоваться перемирием, который на самом деле лишь утвердит грешника в его грехе и может оттолкнуть его ещё дальше от Царствия. Суть бытия миротворцем - это самому жить святую жизнь, и призывать к этому других.
(МакАртур)

5:9: (<u>vs. the sword Jesus brings</u>) Jesus said in Mt 10:34: “I have not come to bring **peace**, but a sword”. His meaning was that the peace He came to bring is not peace at any price; there will be opposition before there is harmony, there will be strife before there is peace. To be peacemakers on God’s terms requires being peacemakers on the terms of truth and righteousness — to which the world is in fierce opposition. When believers set God’s standards of righteousness before a world that loves wickedness, there is an inevitable potential for conflict. Yet that is the only way. (MacArthur)

5:9: (<u>believers are messengers of peace</u>) Men are without peace because they are without God, who is the source of **peace**. God is the maker of **peace**; the believers are the messengers of His peace. Only those who belong to the Maker of peace can be messengers of peace. Those whom God has called to peace He also calls to make peace.
Paul says that in Christ God “has reconciled (made peace) the world to Himself”, and we are His “ambassadors”, entrusted with “the message of reconciliation” (2 Cor 5:18-20). Reconciliation, that is, peace. (MacArthur)

5:9: (<u>characteristics of a peacemaker</u>) 
1) He is one who himself made **peace** with God. No matter what we may consciously have thought about God, out hearts were against Him, we were at war with God, “we were enemies” of God that “were reconciled” to Him (Rom 5:10). When we received CHrist as Savior and He imputed His righteousness to us, our battle with God ended, and our peace with God began. 
2) Because **peace** is always corrupted by sin, the peacemaking believer must be a holy believer, a believer whose life is continually cleansed by the Holy Spirit. The disobedient, self-indulgent Christian is not suited to be an ambassador of peace. 
3) A **peacemaker** leads others to make peace with God. Christians are not elite corps of those who have spiritually arrived and who look down on the rest of the world. They are a body of sinners cleansed by Jesus Christ and commissioned to carry His gospel of cleansing to the rest of the world. 
4) The **peacemaking** spirit is based on humility, sorrow over its own sin, gentleness, hunger for righteousness, mercy, and purity of heart (the other beatitudes). The peacemaker is a beggar who had been fed and who is called to help feed others. Having been brought to God, he is to bring others to God. To bring a person to saving knowledge of Jesus Christ is the most peacemaking act a human being can perform. 
5) A **peacemaker** helps others make peace with others. He builds bridges between men and God and also between men and other men. It starts with building bridges between ourselves and others. Jesus says to “be reconciled to your brother” before coming to the altar (Mt 5:23-24); Paul says to be “so far as it depends on us, be at peace with all men” (Rom 12:18). We are even to “Love your enemies and pray for those who persecute” us, “so that you may be sons of your Father who is in heaven” (Mt 5:44-45). 
By definition a bridge needs support from both sides. So in any relationship we are to see that our own side has a solid base, and it is also our responsibility to help the one on the other side build his base well. Both sides must be built on righteousness and truth, or the bridge will not stand. God’s peacemakers must first be righteous themselves, and then must be active in helping others become righteous.
The first step in that bridge-building process is often to rebuke others about their sin, which is the supreme barrier to peace. “If your brother sins, go and reprove him in private” (Mt 18:15-17). If we do so in the way and in the spirit the Lord teaches, the consequences are His responsibility. There may be a price to pay, but any sacrifice is small in order to obey God. Not to do so does not preserve peace but through disobedience establishes a truce with sin. And the only way to peace is the way of righteousness. Sin that is not dealt with is sin that will disrupt and destroy peace.
6) A **peacemaker** endeavors to find a point of agreement. Wrong theology, wrong standards, wrong beliefs, and wrong attitudes must be faced and dealt with, but they are not usually the best places to start the process of witnessing or peacemaking. God’s people are to contend without being contentions, to disagree without being disagreeable, and to confront without being abusive. The peacemaker speaks the truth in love (Eph 4:15). To start with love is to start toward peace. We begin peacemaking by starting with whatever peaceful point of agreement we can find. The peacemaker always gives others the benefit of the doubt: he never assumes they will resist the gospel or reject his testimony. When he does meet opposition, he tries to be patient with other people’s blindness and stubbornness just as he knows the Lord was, and continues to be, patient with his own blindness and stubbornness.
(MacArthur)

5:9: перевод: (<u>Характеристики миротворца</u>)
1. Миротворец - это человек, который, в первую очередь, сам был примирён с Богом. Вне зависимости от того, что мы думали о Боге до своего примирения, наши сердца были настроены против Него, мы были "врагами" Богу, но "примирились" с Ним (Рим 5:10). Когда мы приняли Иисуса как Спасителя, он привил нам Свою праведность, и наша война с Богом прекратилась: настало перемирие с Богом.
2. Поскольку грех всегда разрушает мир, то верующий миротворец должен быть святым верующим: человеком, чья жизнь непрерывно очищается Святым Духом. Непокорный и потакающий своим желаниям христианин не подходит для того, чтобы быть "служителем примирения" людей с Богом (2 Кор 5:18: мы служители примирения)
3. Миротворец ведёт других к примирению с Богом. Христиане - это не элитный отряд тех, кто в духовном смысле уже приехал, и теперь свысока смотрит на всех окружающих. Миротворцы - это группа грешников которые были очищены Иисусом Христом, и которым теперь поручено нести Его Евангелие очищения всему остальному миру.
4. Дух миротворчества основан на смирении ("блаженны нищие духом"), на скорби о своём грехе ("блаженны плачущие"), на кроткости ("блаженны кроткие"), на жажде праведности ("блаженны алчущие праведности"), на милосердии ("блаженны милосердные"), и на чистоте сердце ("блаженны чистые сердцем"). Дух миротворчества, седьмое блаженство, основан на предыдущих шести блаженствах из Матфея 5:3-8. Миротворец должен осознавать, что он в духовном смысле - нищий бессеребренник, которого накормили и напоили, и призвали помогать кормить других. Будучи приведённым к Богу, он должен вести к Богу других. А привести человека к Богу - это самое миротворческое деяние, которое человек способен совершить, потому что настоящий мир может быть основан только на той праведности, что исходит от Бога.
5. Миротворец помогает другим людям примиряться друг с другом. Миротворец строит мосты между людьми и Богом, а также между самими людьми. Этот процесс начинается с построения мостов между собой и другими людьми.
Иисус сказал, "иди и примирись с братом твоим", прежде чем подходить к алтарю (Мф 5:23-24). Павел учил "быть в мире со всеми, насколько это зависит от вас" (Рим 12:18). Мы даже должны "любить врагов наших", "благословлять проклинающих нас" и "молиться за обижающих нас", -- для того чтобы "будете сынами Отца вашего Небесного" (Мф 5:44-45).
По определению, мост, чтобы устоять, требует поддержки на обоих берегах. Так и в любых взаимоотношениях нам нужно следить за тем, чтобы у нашей стороны был прочный фундамент, а наша вторая ответственность - помогать человеку на другой стороне укреплять и свой фундамент! Миротворцы должны заботиться об обоих сторонах моста. И обе стороны должны быть построены на праведности, иначе мост не устоит. Божии миротворцы должны быть праведны сами, а так же должны активно помогать окружающим становиться праведными.
Первый шаг к построению мостов часто начинается с обличения человека в его грехе, и такое обличение послужит огромной преградой к примирению. Однако сказано, "если же согрешит против тебя брат твой, пойди и обличи его между тобою и им одним". (** здесь МакАртур почему-то не обращает внимание на то, что стих говорит о человеке верующем, а не о мирском. -- прим. перев.). Если же мы поступим так, как Господь нас учит, то Бог берёт на Себя ответственность за последствия. Да, там может быть цена, которую придётся заплатить; но нет такой цены, которая была бы слишком высокой, чтобы слушаться Бога. Если же не обличить брата, то между вами может установиться [хрупкий] мир, основанный на непослушании, на перемирии со грехом. Однако же, единственный путь к настоящему перемирию - это праведность. Грех, над которым не совершена работа, разрушит и уничтожит любой мир. 
6. Миротворец всегда старается найти точки соприкосновения; темы, в которых с человеком есть согласие. Да, нужно будет обязательно разобраться со грехом, ущербным учением, искажёнными стандартами, ошибочными верованиями, и прочим; однако начинать процесс примирения с этих конфликтных тем - обычно не очень хорошая идея. Свидетельство тоже с них не начинается. Божьи люди должны бороться не ссорясь, должны уметь разойтись во мнениях не будучи при этом тяжёлым собеседником, должны противостоять не оскорбляя. Миротворец должен говорить истину с любовью (Еф 4:15, НРП). Если общение начато с любовью, то оно будет двигаться в сторону примирения. Так, примирение нужно начинать с любой точки соприкосновения, которую мы сможем найти. Миротворец должен подарить человеку своё доверие, не предполагая в своём сердце, что тот будет противостоять Евангелию или отвергать его свидетельство. Однако столкнувшись с сопротивлением, миротворец должен относиться с терпением к слепоте и упрямству других людей, помня про себя, что Бог так же терпелив к нашей слепоте и упрямству. 
(МакАртур)

5:9:  (<u>the logical sequence and progression of beatitudes</u>) The **peacemaking** spirit is based on humility, sorrow over its own sin, gentleness, hunger for righteousness, mercy, and purity of heart. “Peacemaking is the propagated character of the man who, exemplifying all the rest of the beatitudes, thereby brings peace wherever he comes” (G. Campbell Morgan). This is a mark of a true kingdom citizen: he not only hungers for righteousness and holiness in his own life, but has a passionate desire to see those virtues in the lives of others. (MacArthur)

5:9: (<u>the merit of peace</u>) The result of peacemaking is eternal blessing as God’s children in God’s kingdom: **sons of God**. The word for sons (Gk. *huios*) is a word which expresses the dignity and honor of the relationship of a child to his parents (unlike *teknon* (child), which is a term of tender affection and endearment). As God’s peacemakers, we are promised the glorious blessing of eternal sonship in His eternal kingdom.
Peacemaking is a hallmark of God’s children. A person who is continually disruptive, divisive, and quarrelsome has good reason to doubt his relationship to God altogether. God’s sons are peacemakers.
(MacArthur)

5:9: **shall be called** is a continuous future passive tense: throughout eternity peacemakers will go by the name “children of God”. God’s children matter dearly to Him, and it is no little thing that we can call Him Father. (MacArthur)




















#### “Blessed are those who are persecuted for righteousness' sake, for theirs is the kingdom of heaven. Blessed are you when others revile you and persecute you and utter all kinds of evil against you falsely on my account. Rejoice and be glad, for your reward is great in heaven, for so they persecuted the prophets who were before you.”

5:10: Господь обещает **гонимым за правду** царство небесное как бы взамен того, чего лишаются они через гонение. (Православный Катехизис Филаретовский)

5:11: **Persecution** for the cause of Christ is part of the Christian Life, because the message is offensive to the world. Persecution is not limited to those outside the church; it can come from within through hypocrites, false brothers, and the spiritually immature. One mark of a false Christian is his doctrine as it affects persecution. He will look, sound, and act very religious, but will compromise truth quickly to appear peaceful and inclusive of others. He will try to appear *reasonable* and avoid issues, and call true Christians troublemakers. (John Strohman)

5:10: The kingdom of the world rejects those who are **righteous**, but **the kingdom of heaven** is theirs instead.

5:10: (<u>worldly happiness vs godly happiness</u>) According to a survey, people would enjoy other people but are not self-sacrificing; they refuse to participate in any negative experiences; and they have a sense of accomplishment based on their self-sufficiency. The world does not associate happiness with humility, mourning over sin, gentleness, righteousness, mercy, purity of heart, or peacemaking holiness. Even less does it associate happiness with persecution.
Jesus says a **blessed** person is the one who recognizes his own emptiness and need, who comes to God as a beggar, knowing he has not resources in himself. He is not confident in his own ability but is very much aware of his own inability. Such a person is not at all positive about himself but mourns over his own sinfulness and isolation from a holy God. To be genuinely content, a person must not be self-serving but self-sacrificing. He must be gentle, merciful, pure in heart, yearn for righteousness, and seek to make peace on God’s terms — even if those attitudes cause him to suffer.
The Lord’s opening thrust climaxes with this great and sobering truth: those who faithfully live according to the beatitudes will inevitably be persecuted for it. Godliness generates hostility and antagonism from the world. The crowning feature of the happy person is persecution! Kingdom people are rejected people. Holy people a singularly **blessed**, but they pay a price for it.
(MacArthur)

5:10: (<u>the persecution</u>) **Those who have been persecuted** are the citizens of the kingdom, those who live out the previous seven beatitudes. To the degree that they fulfill the first seven they may experience the eighth. “All who desire to live a godly life in Christ Jesus will be persecuted” (2 Tim 3:12). “...these afflictions …, we are destined for this” (1 Thess 3:3-4).
To live for Christ is to live in opposition to satan in his world and in his system. Those born only of the flesh will persecute those born of the Spirit. Righteousness is confrontational: it confronts wickeness by its very contrast, if not by spoken word. Abel did not preach to Cain, but Abel’s righteous life, typified by his proper sacrifice to the Lord, was a constant rebuke to his wicked brother.
Persecution is one of the surest and most tangible evidences of salvation. Ridicule, criticism, resentment and rejection is part of the normal Christian life. We must be willing to endure whatever trouble our faithfulness to Jesus Christ may bring, and to see it as a confirmation of true salvation.
Some costs will be great and some will be slight. Faithfulness always has a cot, which true Christians are willing to pay.
A man once approached Tertullian and asked, “I have come to Christ, but I don’t think that my job is consistent with what Scripture teaches. What can I do? I must live.”. To that, Tertullian replied, “Must you?”. Loyalty to Christ is the Christian’s only true choice. To be prepared for kingdom life is to be prepared for loneliness, misunderstanding, ridicule, rejection, and unfair treatment of every sort. 
Jesus is not speaking of every hardship, problem, or conflict believers may face, but those that the world brings on us *because of* our faithfulness to the Lord.
(MacArthur)

5:10: “Though they be never so meek, merciful, pure in heart, their piety will not shield them from sufferings. They must hand their harp on the willows and take the cross. The way to heaven is by way of thorns and blood… Set it down as a maxim, if you will follow Christ, you must see the swords and staves” (Thomas Watson).

5:10: (<u>verbal insults</u>) Jesus promises that kingdom citizens are **blessed** … **when men cast insults** at them, “insults” carrying the idea of reviling, upbraiding, or seriously insulting: to throw abusive words in the face of an opponent, to mock viciously. 
Faithfulness to Christ may even cause friends and loved ones to say things that cut and hurt deeply. 
(MacArthur)

5:10: (<u>false accusation</u>) Faithfulness to Christ will bring enemies of the gospel to **say all kinds of evil against** us **falsely.** Whereas **insults** are abusive words said to our faces, these evil things are primarily abusive words said behind our backs. Slander behind our backs is harder to take because it harms our reputation even before we are aware of it and have a chance to correct it.
Arthur Pink comments that “it is a strong proof of human depravity that men’s curses and Christ’s blessings should meet on the same persons”. 
(MacArthur)

5:10: (<u>the world against righteousness</u>) Jesus is not speaking of every hardship, but that which the world brings on us *because of* our faithfulness to the Lord. The hallmark of the **blessed** person is **righteousness**; holy living is what provokes persecution of God’s people. When we are hated, the real animosity is not against us but against Christ. Satan’s great enemy is Christ, and he opposes us because He is in us. When we are despised and attacked by the world, the real target is the rigtheousness for which we snand and which we exemplify. 
That is why it is easy to escape persecution: the world will accept us if we are willing to compromise our beliefs and standards and put some distance between ourselves and the Lord’s righteousness. “If you were of the world, the world would love its own” (Jn 15:19) 
(MacArthur)

5:10: (<u>avoiding persecution by compromise</u>) The way to avoid **persecution** is easy: “live and let live”. Mimic the world’s standards; never criticize them; keep quiet about the gospel, especially the truth that apart from its saving power men remain in their sins and are destined to hell; laugh at its jokes, let it mock God and be ashamed to take a stand for Christ. Those are the habits of sham Christians.
Jesus does not take faithlessness lightly: “whoever is ashamed of me and of my words, of him will the Son of Man be ashamed” (Lk 9:26). To be popular with everyone is to compromise the faith.
We live in a day when the church, more than ever before, is engaged in self-glorification and an attempt to gain worldly recognition that must be repulsive to God. When the church tries to use the things of the world to do the work of heaven, it only succeeds in hiding heaven from the world. And when the world is pleased with the church, we can be sure that God is not. We can be  equally sure that when we are pleasing to God, we will not be pleasing to the system of satan.
(MacArthur)

5:10: (<u>the promise</u>) Jesus pronounces a double **blessing** on those who are **persecuted for the sake of righteousness**, which is **for His own sake**. The specific blessing is that **theirs is the kingdom of heaven**. 
I believe that the blessings of the **kingdom** are threefold: present, millennial, and eternal. “Shall receive a hundred times as much now in the present age, … along with persecutions, … and in the age to come, evernal life” (Mk 10:29-30)
(MacArthur)

5:10: (<u>the logical sequence and progression of beatitudes</u>) The central theme of beatitudes is righteousness. The first two have to do with recognizing our own unrighteousness, and the next five have to do with our seeking and reflecting righteousness. The last beatitude has to do with our suffering **for the sake of righteousness**. (MacArthur)

5:10: (<u>the worldly reaction to beatitudes</u>) The world cannot handle the righteous life that characterizes kingdom living. It is not understandable and acceptable to them, and they cannot stomach it even in others. Poverty of spirit runs counter to the pride of unbelieving heart. The repentant, contrite disposition that mourns over sin in never appreciated by the callous, indifferent, unsympathetic world. The meek and quiet spirit that takes wrong and does not strike back is regarded as pusillanimous (showing lack of courage and determination), and it rasps against the militant, vengeful spirit characteristic of the world. To long after righteousness is repugnant to those whose fleshly cravings are rebuked by it, as is a merciful spirit to those whose hearts are hard and cruel. Purity of heart is a painful light that exposes hypocrisy and corruption, and peacemaking is a virtue praised by the contentious, self-seeking world in words but not in heart. 
(MacArthur)

5:11: **When** (Gk. *hotan*) can also mean whenever: whenever opposition, ridicule, or persecution comes, we should not be surprised or resentful. Jesus was not *constantly* opposed: there were times of peace and even popularity. (MacArthur)

5:12: (<u>be active</u>) The believer’s response to persecution should not be to retreat and hide. To escape from the world is to escape responsibility. 
We are no longer *of* this world, but He has sent us *into* this world to serve, just as Christ came to serve. His followers are “the salt of the earth” and the “light of the world” (vv. 13-14). For our salt to flavor the earth and our light to lighten the world we must be active in the world. The gospel is not to be hidden but to enlighten: “let your light shine before men” (vv. 15-16). Our salt will sting the world’s open wounds of sin, and out light will irritate its eyes that are used to darkness. 
(MacArthur)

5:12: (<u>be glad</u>) Even when your salt and light are resented and rejected, we should **rejoice and be glad**. **Be glad** (Gk. *agalliao*) literally means to skip and jump with happy excitement, to exult and be overjoyed. The imperative mood makes it a command, not merely a suggestion: we are *commanded* **to be glad**. Not to be glad when we suffer for Christ’s sake is to be untrusting and disobedient.
The world can take away a great deal from God’s people, but it cannot take away their joy. We know that nothing the world can do to us is permanent.
(MacArthur)

5:12: (<u>the reward</u>) Whatever we do for the Lord now, including suffering for Him, reaps eternal dividends: **your reward is great in heaven**. They are not only eternal but are also **great**, for God “is able to do far more abundantly than all that we ask or think” (Eph 3:20). 
We serve and obey Christ first of all because we love Him, but secondly, it’s neither selfish nor unscriptural to do the Lord’s work for a motive that He Himself gives and has followed: for the reward.
(MacArthur)




















#### Salt and Light

5:13: **Salt** is a flavoring, and a preservative. As Christian, we are to be people of influence, and not just be "tasteless" . We are to serve as a preserving elements of an otherwise degrading and ungodly society. (John Strohman)

5:13-14: We are no longer of this world, but He has sent us into this world to serve, just as Christ came to serve. For our **salt** to flavor the earth and our **light** to lighten the world we must be active in the world. The gospel is not to be hidden but to enlighten. Our salt will sting the world’s open wounds of sin, and out light will irritate its eyes that are used to darkness. (MacArthur)

5:16: We cannot influence the world for God if we live like the world does; it has to be different, and be evident, like a bright **light** that is not hidden. (John Strohman)

5:13: Thought Jesus was speaking before a great multitude, this teaching was primarily for His disciples. The principles He teaches are appropriate only for believers, for they are impossible to follow apart from the power of God’s own Spirit. (MacArthur)

5:13-16: (<u>influence</u>) In these four verses, the Lord summarizes the function of believers in the world. Reduced to one word, that function is *influence*. 
Christian character consciously or unconsciously affects other people for better or for worse. As John Donne reminds us, “No man is an island”. Elihu Burritt wrote, “No human being can come into this world without increasing or diminishing the sum total of human happiness, not only of the present, but of every subsequent age of humanity. No one can detach himself from this connection.”. 
Christ’s kingdom people are not to reflect the world (1 Jn 2:15: “do not love the world, nor the things of the world”), but they are to influence the world. They are to be in it, but not of it.
When we live the Beatitudes out, some people will respond and be saved, others will ridicule and persecute us. “For we are the aroma of Christ: … to one a fragrance from death to death, to the other a fragrance from life to life.” (2 Cor 2:15-16). We are “a chosen race, a royal priesthood … that may proclaim the excellencies of Him Who has called … into light” (1 Pet 2:9). The world has no other way of knowing God except through the testimony of what we are.
(MacArthur)

5:13-16: (<u>corruption and darkness</u>) The presupposition is that the world needs **salt** because it is corrupt, and that it needs **light** because it is dark. (MacArthur)

5:13-14: (<u>the effect of salt and light</u>) We are God’s **salt** to retard corruption (salt is a preservative), and His **light** to reveal truth. One function is negative, the other positive. One is silent, the other is verbal. By the indirect influence we retard corruption, and by the direct influence of what we say we manifest light. 
Both salt and light are unlike that which they are to influence. God has changed us from being part of the corrupted and corrupting world to being salt that can help preserve it; He has changed us from our own darkness to be His agents of giving light to others. The influence is different from that which it influences.
(MacArthur)

5:13-14: The pronoun **you** in both verses is emphatic, saying, “*only* you”: “you are the only **salt**, you are the only **light**”. The “**you**” in both verses is also plural: it is His whole body, the church, that is called to be the world’s **salt and light**. Each grain of salt has its limited influence, but it is only as the church collectively is scattered in the world that change will come. (MacArthur)

5:13: (<u>the value of salt</u>) Salt has been more valuable than it is today. In ancient Greece, it was called *theon*, which means divine. For Romans, nothing was more valuable than salt. Often Roman soldiers were paid in salt, and it was from that practice that the expression “not worth his salt” originated.
In many societies, salt was a mark of friendship: even if a worst enemy ate salt with you, you were obliged to treat him as a friend. It was also used when making a covenant, even in the OT (2 Chr 13:5: covenant of salt with David; Lev 2:13: offerings with salt).
When people heard this **salt** metaphor, they knew that His followers were to have an extremely important function in the world. Salt always stood for that which was of high value and importance.
(MacArthur)

5:13: The meaning of **salt**. 1) **salt** is white and therefore represents purity; it contrasts with the moral discolor of the world. True, but not the point, because saltiness, not the color, is the issue. 2) Just as many foods are tasteless without salt, the world is drab and tasteless without the presence of Christians that add divine flavor to the world. The problem with this view is that in the world’s eyes, Christians actually take the flavor *out of* life, being stifling and restrictive. 3) Because salt stings when placed in a wound, Christians are to sting the world, prick its conscience, make it uncomfortable in the presence of God’s holy gospel. To confront people with their lostness and their desperate need to be saved from their sin. 4) Salt creates thirst. God intends for HIs people so to live and testify before the world that others will be made more aware of their spiritual dehydration and danger. A person may see our peace in a trying circumstance, and thereby be persuaded to try our faith. 
I believe the primary characteristic Jesus emphasizes is that of preservation: Christians are a preserving influence that retards moral and spiritual spoilage. Once God’s people are removed it will take only seven years for the world to descend to the very pits of hellishness (2 Thess 2:7: “Only he who now restrains [lawlessness] it will do so until he is out of the way.”; Dan 9:27: one week). 
(MacArthur)

5:13: Much salt in Palestine was contaminated with gypsum that make its taste flat and even repulsive. When such contaminated salt was found in a household, it was thrown out — but not on a garden, where it would kill the plants; instead, it would be thrown onto a road where it would gradually be **trampled** into dirt and disappear. 
There is a way in which salt cannot really become unsalty; but it can become contaminated and lose its value as salt. Its saltiness can no longer function.
Jesus is not speaking of losing salvation; Christians can lose their value and effectiveness in the kingdom when sin and worldliness contaminate their lives, just as **salt** can **become tasteless** when contaminated by other minerals.  
(MacArthur)

5:14: The meaning of **light**. While salt works secretly, **light** works openly. Salt works from within, light works from without. Salt works indirectly, through our living; light works directly, primarily through what we teach and preach. Salt retards but does not change; but the light can reveal and change.
Christ is the true light, and we are His reflections. He is the Sun, and we are His moons.  God sheds His light on the world through those who have received His light through Jesus Christ. (MacArthur)

5:14: By its nature **light** must be visible in order to illuminate. Christians must be the direct and noticeable instruments of light. Both in the daytime and at night, **a city set on a hill cannot be hidden**: by day its buildings stand out on the landscape, and at night the many lights shining out of its windows make it impossible to miss. (MacArthur)

5:15: A secret Christian is as incongruous as a **hidden light**. Lights are to illuminate, not to be hidden. A hidden light is useless light. Whether we hide our light because of fear of offending others, because of indifference and lovelessness, or because of anything else, we demonstrate unfaithfulness to the Lord. (MacArthur)

5:16: Even though the **Father **is** in Heaven**, people who are on earth can know His qualities by what they see in His people. The **good works** they do manifest the character of God.

5:16: The purpose of being **salt **and **light** is to **glorify the Father**. When we do **good works**, they reveal the beauty the Lord has worked in us. To see the good works by us is to see Christ in us. Those good works is not something we create, but something we allow the Lord to do through us. This is the supreme calling of life: glorifying God. Everything we do is to cause others to give praise to the God who is the source of all that is good.
But when what we do causes people to be attracted to us rather than to God, to see our human character rather than His divine character, we can be sure that what they see is not His light. (MacArthur)

5:16: **Let your light shine before others**. This is the core message of Christianity: God saves people from sin. And after saving the sinner, God leaves this sinner on Earth so that others can see that He is a saving God. When they see that, they will glorify him, meaning, that they will Mill what he can do, and perhaps, want it for themselves. (MacArthur)




















#### Christ Came to Fulfill the Law

5:17-20: Framework:
v. 17: the *preeminence* of Scripture (def: the superiority, surpassing all others)
v. 18: the *permanence* of Scripture (def: lasting or remaining unchanged indefinitely)
v. 19: the *pertinence* of Scripture (def: relevant or applicable to a particular matter)
v. 10: the *purpose* of Scripture (def: the reason for which something is done or created)
First, Jesus pointed out the law’s superiority, because it was authored by God, affirmed by the prophets, and accomplished by the Messiah. Next, He showed its permanence, its lasting without the smallest change or reduction. Then, He showed its pertinence: citizens of the kingdom are still under the full requirements of the OT law and are not to diminish or disobey it. (MacArthur)

5:17-20: (<u>the flow of the Sermon on the Mount</u>) Like Beatitudes, every teaching flows out of the preceding one. The Beatitudes (vv. 3-12) depict the character of believers, who are kingdom citizens and children of God. The Salt and Light (vv. 13-16) teach the function of believers in a corrupt and darkened world. The Law verses (vv. 17-20) teach the foundation for the inner qualities and the function of believers: God’s Word, the only standard of righteousness and truth. (MacArthur)

5:17: (<u>relative morals</u>) A consistent, coherent legal system cannot be built on the principle that right and wrong fluctuate according to man’s ideas and feelings. There has to be an absolute, a global standard, and that standard used to be religion. Now, when religion and law are increasingly being decoupled, our         culture experiences a massive loss of confidence in both law and religion. A godless society, floating on the sea of relativism, realizes that it has no foundation, no anchor, no unmoving point of reference. (MacArthur)

5:17: (<u>Bible is outdated</u>) We continually hear the idea that because times have changed, the Bible does not fit our day. The truth, of course, is the opposite. The Bible always fits, because the Bible is God’s perfect, eternal, and infallible Word. It is the standard by which true “fit” is measured. It is the world that does not fit the Bible; and not because the world has changed, but because the Bible has *not* changed. Outwardly the world has changed a great deal since biblical days, but in its basic nature and orientation is has always been opposed to God and has never conformed to His Word. The world has never fit Scripture. (MacArthur)

5:17: (<u>Jesus did not identify with any school</u>) Jesus did not identify Himself with any of the scribal schools, or with any of the sects or movements of the time. Nor did He identify Himself with Herod or with Rome. Instead, Jesus openly and lovingly identified Himself with the outcast, the sick, the sinful, and then eedy of every sort. He proclaimed grace and dispensed mercy. Whereas all the other rabbis and religious leaders talked only about the religious externals, He taught about the heart. They focused on ceremonies, rituals, and outward acts of every kind, whereas he focused on the heart. They set themselves above other men and demanded their service, while He set Himself below other men and became their Servant. (MacArthur)

5:17: (<u>The Messiah was expected to change the Law</u>) of primary concern to every faithful Jew seeking to evaluate Jesus was, “What does He think of the **Law**, of Moses** and the prophets**?”. The leaders often confronted Jesus with matters of the Law.
Many Jews believed that *the Messiah would radically revise, or completely overturn the Mosaic law*  and establish His own new standards: they interpreted Jer 31:31 (“the days are coming ... when I will make a new covenant”) as teaching that God’s new covenant would annul (**“abolish”**) the old covenant and start over on a completely new moral basis (Jer 31:32: “not like the covenant that I made with their fathers”).
For the Pharisees, whose teaching was essentially based on a *God’s standard reduced* — to a level that humans could keep, Jesus fit none of the common molds: He obviously had a high regard for the law, His teachings did not lower scriptural standards, but He taught contrary to the traditions and upheld the Law in every way. He put God’s standard at the height where it belonged, and He Himself lived at that humanly impossible level. (MacArthur)

5:17: (<u>external and internal obedience</u>) Many Jews understood “**the Law**” as the rabbinical and scribal traditions, which actually “invalidated the Word of God” (Mt 15:6) in the way it was written. On the surface, it seemed hard; in reality, it was entirely external, demanding no heart obedience and no faith in God.
God’s law had always required inward as well as outward obedience (Isa 29:13: they “honor Me with their lips, while their hearts are far from Me“).  

5:17: (the impression of doing away with the law) Jesus, however, did not scrupulously follow the rabbinic traditions, which most Jews thought to be proper interpretations of the law of Moses, so Jessu was seen by some as **doing away with the Law**. Jesus’ warning, **do not think**, indicates that most of His hearers had a wrong conception about His teaching. 
(MacArthur)

5:17: **Abolish **(Gk. *kataluo*): to utterly overthrow or destroy. Same word used of the destruction of the Temple, of the death of the physical body. The basic idea is to tear down and smash, to obliterate completely; figuratively: to bring to naught, to render useless, nullify. (MacArthur)

5:17: **the Law**: by using a definite article (**the**), Jesus made clear He spoke about *the *Law of God. (MacArthur)

5:17: (<u>rabbinical law elaborated the Scripture</u>) During the Exile, and especially during the intertestamental period, the traditions were greatly multiplied and covered almost every conceivable activity a person could be involved in. 
In elaborating scriptures, they went into great detail. For instance, concerning the Sabbath law, they decided that a “burden” is food equal to the weight of a fig, milk enough for one swallow, honey enough to put on a wound, paper enough to write a customs house notice, ink enough to write two letters of the alphabet, reed enough to make a pen, and so on and on. To carry anything more than those prescribed amounts on the Sabbath was to break the law.
Since it was not possible to anticipate every contingency, much time was spent arguing whether a tailor committed a sin if he went out on the Sabbath with a needle stuck in his robe, or whether moving a lamp from one place in a room to another was permissible. Some strict interpreters believed that even wearing an artificial leg or using a crutch or lifting a baby constituted work. They decided that to heal was work, but made exceptions for grave situations ­— but just enough treatment to keep the patient from getting worse was allowed.
(MacArthur)

5:17: (<u>law accomplished by Christ</u>) Jesus came **to fulfill the Law**. In His incarnation; in the work of the Holy Spirit through the church; in His coming again, — Jesus would fulfill all of the Law: moral, judicial, and ceremonial. The word means to fill up; not to add, but to complete what is already present. Jesus did not add any basic new teaching but rather clarified God’s original meaning. 
First, Jesus **fulfilled the Law** by fully meeting its demands: He perfectly kept every part of the law. He was perfectly righteous and did not violate the smallest part of God’s law. 
But most importantly, Jesus **fulfilled the Law** by *being its fulfillment*. He did not simply teach; He *was* it fully; He did not come simply to teach righteousness, or to model righteousness; He came *as *divine righteousness. What He said and what He did reflected who He *is*. (MacArthur)

5:17: (<u>Jesus fulfilled the ceremonial law</u>) The heart of all OT worship was sacrifice, and Jesus, as the perfect Sacrifice, brought all the other sacrifices to an end. While He was on the cross, the “veil of the temple was torn in two” (Mt 27:51), because Christ Himself was the new and perfect way into the Holy of Holies, into which any man could come by faith. (Heb 10:19-22: “we have confidence to enter the holy place by the blood of Jesus, by new and living way”).
Even before Christ, those sacrifices did not have the power to cleanse from sin; they were only pictures of the Messiah’s work of cleansing. 
(MacArthur)

5:17: (<u>Jesus fulfilled the Sabbath</u>) The essence of Sabbath observance was holiness, not resting or refraining from work. It was a provision means to remove the heart from earthly endeavors and to turn it toward God. Because Christ fulfilled all righteousness and has become our righteousness, the purpose of Sabbath observance ended at the cross. Christians possess the reality, and so no longer need the symbol. All believers have entered into permanent salvation rest, as the writer of Hebrews carefully points out (4:1-11: believing Christians enter Sabbath rest, linked to divine rest on day 7). Every day becomes holy to the Lord.
In demonstration of that fact, the early church had thrit primary worship meetings held on the first day of the week (1 Cor 16:2: “On the first day of every week, each of you is to put something aside and store it up”; Acts 20:7: “On the first day of the week, when we were gathered together to break bread”) which came to be called “the Lord’s day” because of its association with Jesus’ resurrection. That day was to stimulate them to holiness every other day as well (Heb 10:24-25: “stir up one another to love and good works, 25 not neglecting to meet together”). As Paul made clear, however, there is not longer any special day of worship (Rom 14:5-6: “ One person esteems one day as better than another, while another esteems all days alike”; Col 2:16-17: “let no judge ... in regard to a Sabbath. These are a shadow of the things to come“). Worship on any day of the week is no less biblical or spiritual than worship on the Lord’s day. Sunday is not the “Christian Sabbath,” as some claim, but is simply the day of worship most Christians have observed since NT times: a special time set aside for spiritual exercises.
(MacArthur)

5:17: (<u>paradox: fulfilled or not?</u>) The Sermon on the Mount makes it absolutely clear that God’s moral law did not cease at Christ’s coming, but was reaffirmed, and remains energized by the Holy Spirit.
There is indeed a paradox, especially evident in Paul’s letters: on one hand, we are told of the law’s being fulfilled and done away with; and on the other, we are still obliged to obey it. 
The ceremonial law also came to an end when the veil was torn in two, and when the Temple worship ended in A.D. 70. 
So, what’s in the end? We are no longer under the penalty of the law, but are far from free of its requirement of righteousness. We are not free from God’s moral standards. The law was once our tutor, now leads us as “sons of God” (Gal 3:24,26) to be clothed with Christ, the source of our practical righteousness.
Paul harmonized the idea when he spoke of himself as being “without the law of God but under the law of Christ” (1 Cor 9:21). Christ’s law is different from the OT law with its penalties and curses for disobedience, but it’s not different in the slightest from the holy, righteous standards that the OT law taught.
The OT law is a moral guide, as in revealing sin (Rom 7:7: “it had not been for the law, I would not have known sin. For I would not have known what it is to covet if the law had not said, “You shall not covet.””), even when it provokes sin (Rom 7:8), it helps us see the wickedness of our own flesh and our helplessness apart from Christ. Whenever a Christian looks at God’s moral law with humility, meekness, and a sincere desire for righteousness, the law will invariably point him to Christ. 
(MacArthur)

5:18: **Truly I say to you** (lit. **amen I say to you**). Jesus confirmed the special importance of the statement that followed. Jesus was saying, “I say this to you absolutely, without qualification and with the fullest authority.” 
His teaching not only was absolute, but was permanent: the law would outlast the universe, **until heaven and earth pass away**. Jesus even equated His own words (**my words**) with the Word of God in that both will not pass away. Jesus’ teaching is timeless.
(MacArthur)

5:18: (<u>Jesus confirms the authority of Scripture</u>) Throughout the NT, Jesus uses Scripture to teach, to make defence, to resist satan, and to reason with the Jews, sometimes basing His argument on a single word (Mt 22:32: “God of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob”; “is”, not “was”). Over and over again, Jesus confirmed the accuracy and the authenticity of the OT. By quoting the Scripture, He testified to their divine origin and authority. (MacArthur)

5:18: The honest Jew knew he could not fulfill all the requirements of the Mosaic law; not even the traditions of the elders. Many hoped the Messiah would bring God’s standard down to a level they could manage. But Jesus made it clear that He had not come to diminish the law in the least bit, but to uphold and fulfill it in every detail. (MacArthur)

5:18: **An iota** is the smallest letter of the Greek alphabet: **ι**. It originated from the semitic Yodh, which was a mere apostrophe, a stroke of a pen: **י**. It was the *Yodh* that Jesus’ Jewish hearers would have heard about. **A stroke** literally means “little horn”: small marks that help distinguish one letter from another. 
The meaning is that not even the tiniest, seemingly most insignificant part of God’s Word will be removed or modified **until all is accomplished**. (MacArthur)

5:18: No other statement made by our Lord more clearly states His absolute contention that Scripture is verbally inerrant, totally without error in the original form in which God gave it, down to every letter and the smallest part of every letter. (MacArthur)

5:19: The **therefore** refers to what Jesus has just said about the law: the law is utterly pertinent to those who trust in God, because it is His Word and is exalted by the prophets and accomplished by the Messiah Himself. (MacArthur)

5:19: By lowering the law you weaken its power in the hands of God as a convincer of sin. “By the law is the knowledge of sin.” It is the looking-glass which shows us our spots, and that is a most useful thing, though nothing but the gospel can wash them away. ... Lower the Law and you dim the light by which man perceives his guilt; this is a very serious loss to the sinner rather than a gain (Charles Spurgeon)

5:19: The consequences of the law depend on a person’s response to it. Whoever responds to it positively, will receive a positive result; but whoever responds to it negatively, will receive a negative result. (MacArthur)

5:19: To **relax** (Gk. luo: to annul, to break, to loosen; or even to dissolve or melt). The idea is to annul God’s law, or to make it void, by loosing ourselves from its requirements and standards. 
Jesus used the same word in a stronger form (*kataluo*) in v. 17: “not to abolish the Law and the prophets”. Same word is used in Mt 16:19 and Mt 18:18: “whatever you loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven”.
Fallen human nature resents prohibitions and demands. Even Christians are tempted to modify and weaken God’s standards, to make them less demanding than they are. But when a Christian ceases to revere and obey God’s Word in even the slightest degree, to that degree He is being un-Christlike. Because that is something Christ refused to do.
(MacArthur)

5:19: **least of these commandments**. Jesus gives indications of the relative importance of God’s commands. There are two great commandments, one is “great and foremost”, and “the second is like it” (Mt 22:37-39). Also, in His series of woes, Jesus speaks about “the weightier provisions of the law: justice and mercy and faithfulness”, which should be “done *without neglecting the others*” (Mt 23:23). 
Some things are more spiritually important than others. But Jesus’ point here is that it’s not permissible to **annul** even one of the least ones. Some commands are greater than others, but none are to be disregarded. (MacArthur)

5:19: **Teaching others to** disregard or disobey any part of God’s word is an even worse offence. James cautions, “teachers … will incur a stricter judgment” (Jas 3:1). Every believer is accountable for himself, but those who teach are also accountable for those whom they teach. 
We teach not only by our words, but also by our example. When we ignore the law’s demands, we give loud testimony to its unimportance to us. ~Living out is teaching out. A believer’s view of Scripture is revealed in his life and teaching.
(MacArthur)

5:19: To **be called least in the kingdom of heaven**. The “**called**” refers not to what men say about us, but to what God says about us, because only God knows what we do and why always, and He always cares. It is God’s prerogative to determine ranks in the kingdom, and Jesus declares that He will hold those in lowest esteem who hold His Word in lowest esteem. There is no impunity (exemption from punishment) for those who disobey, discredit, or belittle God’s law. (MacArthur) 

5:19: Note that offenders do not lose their salvation, but are **called least**, yet still remain **in the kingdom of heaven**. But blessing, reward, fruitfulness, joy, and usefulness, will all be sacrificed to the extent that we are disobedient. What we may lose is “a full reward” (2 Jn 8: “Watch yourselves, so that you may not lose what we have worked for, but may win a full reward”). It is possible to lose in the second phase of our Christian lives what we built up in the first. (MacArthur) 

5:19: **Whoever keeps them and teaches them** is a person who upholds every part of God’s law, both in their living and in their teaching. (MacArthur)

5:19: God's moral law is the reflection of God's very character, and is therefore changeless and eternal. The things it requires will not have to be commanded **in heaven**, but they will be manifested in heaven because they manifest God. While on earth, we do not naturally reflect the character of God, but His moral standards continue to be commanded and supernaturally produced. (MacArthur)

5:20: Man-made religion or self-righteousness will never get one even close to the kingdom of Heaven. (John Strohman)

5:20: (<u>self-righteousness is insufficient</u>) It is the false teaching of salvation by self-effort that Jesus confronts head-on in this verse, and which all of Scripture, from beginning to end, contradicts. 
The parable of the **Pharisee** and a tax-collector was told “to some who *trusted in themselves* that they were righteous, and treated others with contempt” (Lk 18:9), where the Pharisee prayed self-righteously. (see note on [Lk 18:9](#id.dwbcdy95tjug)). 
The Jews had a saying, “If only two people go to heaven, one will be a scribe, and the other a pharisee”. Those men were completely convinced that God was obligated to honor their devoted and demanding works. In comparing themselves with others, they could not imagine God was not favorably impressed with their goodness.
Jesus teaches that that the sort of **righteousness** exemplified by the Pharisees was not sufficient to gain entrance into His **kingdom**. To Jesus’ legalistic, works-oriented hearers, this was doubtlessly the most radical thing He had yet taught. If the meticulously religious and moral Pharisee could not get into heaven, who could?
(MacArthur)

5:20: (<u>more is required</u>) After showing the preeminence (v. 17), permanence (v. 18), and pertinence (v. 19) of Scripture, Jesus now shows its purpose. In context, Jesus says that whatever they did with man-made tradition, they did not live up to the standards of Scripture.
The implied truth of the verse is this: the purpose of God’s law was to show that, to please God and to be worthy of citizenship in His kingdom, more righteousness is required that anyone can possibly have or accomplish in himself. The purpose of the law was not to show what to do in order to make oneself acceptable, but to show how utterly sinful and helpless all men are in themselves.
The initial step toward kingdom citizenship is poverty of spirit: recognizing one’s total wretchedness and inadequacy before God.
(MacArthur)

5:20: (<u>the righteousness God requires</u>) **Surpasses** is used of a river overflowing its banks, emphasizing that which is far in excess of the normal. The Lord requires genuine **righteousness**, real holiness that far exceeds anything human (“human banks”) and that exists only in the redeemed heart, for “the Lord looks at the heart” (1 Sam 16:7)
When the inside is beautiful, outward beauty is appropriate; but without inner beauty, outward adornment is pretense and sham.
God not only requires inner righteousness, but perfect righteousness. “You therefore must be perfect, as your heavenly Father is perfect.” (Mt 5:48). To be qualified for God’s kingdom, we must be as holy as the King Himself. That standard is so infinitely high that even the most self-righteousness person would not dare to claim to possess it or be able to attain it.
(MacArthur)

5:20: (<u>the righteousness God gives</u>) How such a holy heart can be obtained? “Who then can be saved?”. Jesus answered: “With men this is impossible, but with God all things are possible” (Mt 19:25-26)
God gives what He demands. The One who tells us of the way into the kingdom is Himself that way (Jn 14:6: “I am the way, and the truth, and the life. No one comes to the Father except through me”).
The King not only sets the standard, but will Himself bring anyone up to that standard who is willing on the King’s terms. This is why “a person is not justified by works of the law but through faith in Jesus Christ” (Gal 2:16). To be justified is to be made righteous, and to be made righteous by Christ is the only way to become righteous.
God gave the impossible standard, and then Himself provided the fulfillment.
(MacArthur)

5:20: (<u>what self-righteousness is</u>) Their **righteousness** was: external, partial, redefined, and self-centered.
<u>External</u>. The scribes and the Pharisees concerned themselves with external observance of the law and tradition, taking little consideration of motives and attitudes. They saw nothing wrong with having evil thoughts as long as they did not carry out those thoughts externally (hate, but not kill; lust, but not have). 
Jesus condemned this sort of hypocritical righteousness in Mt 23 with series of woes. Jesus’ next teachings in the Sermon on the Mount shows that God’s first concern is with the heart: with such things as anger, hatred, and lust. Hypocrisy cannot substitute for holiness. 
Same applies to religious ceremony: unless our giving, prayer, and fasting are done out of humble, loving spirit, they count for nothing (6:5-18). Ritual cannot substitute for righteousness.
<u>Partial</u>. The righteousness they practiced was partial, woefully incomplete. They tithed, but showed total disregard for weightier matters such as justice, marcy, and faithfulness, because those things are essentially the reflections of a transformed heart. It is impossible to be merciful, just, and faithful, without a divinely wrought change. No external formality can produce that.
<u>Redefined</u>. Like many liberal theologians of today, the scribes and the Pharisees took biblical terms and redefined them to suit their own human perspectives and philosophy, and reworked biblical standards in keeping with their own desires and capabilities.
Even such commands as “Consecrate yourselves therefore, and be holy; for I am holy” (Lev 11:44) they interpreter not as a call to pure heart, but as a requirements of certain rituals. Knowing they can’t be holy, they simply changed the meaning of holiness.
<u>Self-Centered</u>. Their righteousness was produced by self, and for the purposes of self-glory. Above all else, they sought to be self-satisfied, and their system of religion was designed to enhance that self-satisfaction by providing ways to accomplish external, showy things about which they could boast and be proud. Their satisfaction came when they received approval and commendation from men.
In stark contrast, the godly person is broken about his sin, mourns about the wicked condition of his inner life, and has absolutely no confidence in what he is and can do. He longs for the righteousness only God can give out of His mercy and grace.
But the person who is righteousness in his own eyes sees no need for any other righteousness, not need for salvation, mercy, forgiveness, or grace. The Pharisees did not want the grace the Messiah now offered; they wanted to rule their own lives their own way. “being ignorant of the righteousness of God, and seeking to establish their own, they did not submit to God's righteousness.” (Rom 10:3).

Those who insist on coming to God in their own way and their own power will never reach Him; they **shall never enter the kingdom of heaven**. No church, no ritual, no works, no philosophy, no system can bring a person to God. Those who try to work their way into God’s grace know nothing of wht His grace is about.
It is tragic that many people today, like the scribes and the Pharisees, will try any way to God but His way. They will pay any price, but will not accept the price He paid. They will do any work for Him, but they will not accept the finished work of His Son for them. Such people are religious but not regenerated, and they **shall not enter the kingdom of heaven**.
(MacArthur)




















#### Introduction: Correcting Pharisees

5:21-43: (<u>contrast</u>) In the rest of the chapter, Jesus gives 6 illustrations correcting the rabbinical, traditional teaching. Knowing that His self-righteous hearers could not possibly understand what He was saying, Jesus contrasted human teaching with the divine Word of God.
In vv. 17-20 Jesus just said that His teaching stands firmly in agreement with the OT teaching, while the Jewish religious tradition *did not*. 
These examples deal with specific subjects of murder, sexual sin, divirce, speaking the truth, retaliation, and loving others. Yet they all illustrate the same basic principle: righteousness is a matter of the heart.
(MacArthur)

5:21-43: (<u>structure</u>) Jesus first refers to two of the Ten Commandments, then to two more general principles in the Law, and finally, to the two broad principles of mercy and love.
(MacArthur)

5:21-43: Every section starts with a form of the phrase “**the ancients told**”, which cannot refer to God’ Word, which Jesus came to uphold. It refers to the human teaching that contradicted God’s Word. (MacArthur)

5:21-43: (<u>Jews separated from scripture</u>) As Martyn Lloyd-Jones has pointed out, the condition of Judaism at the time of Christ was remarkably like that of the church in the early 16-th century. The Scriptures were not translated into the languages of the people. The liturgy, the prayers, the Scripture reading, and even most of the hymns and anthems were in Latin, which none of the common people knew or understood. When a priest gave a sermon or homily, the people had nothing by which to judge what he said. They had no idea as to whether or not his message was scriptural, or even whether or not being scriptural was important. The Bible taught what the church said it taught. The church, therefore, placed its own authority over that of Scripture. 
In a less extreme way, the Jews of Jesus’ day had been separated from their Scriptures. Even though there was a Septuagint, it was bulky and expensive, and it was not used or understood by most Jews in Palestine. When it was read, most hearers understood little, and accepted whatever the leaders said.
ANd most scribes and rabbis did not attempt to expound the scriptural text itself, but rather taught from the Talmud, an exhaustive collection of rabbinical traditions.
(MacArthur)




















#### Anger

5:21-26: (<u>the flow of the Sermon on the Mount</u>) From the beginning of the Sermon on the Mount, Jesus focuses on the internal, on what men are like in their minds and hearts. This is the primary thrust of the rest of the chapter. Contrary to the superficial righteousness of the Pharisees, God requires internal righteousness. If it does not exist in the heart, it does not exist at all. 
(MacArthur)

5:21: An important biblical principle: although one may think himself good by his external deeds, *God judges the heart*. (John Strohman)

5:21: **Those of old** refers to the rabbis and scribes **of old** who had devised the many traditions with which Judaism had become encumbered and which had virtually replaced the authority of the Scriptures. (MacArthur)

5:21: (<u>Why murder is a sin</u>) In the OT, the penalty for **the killer** was death, and the reason for such severe punishment was that man was made in God’s image. To take the life is to assault the sacredness of the image of God. (MacArthur)

5:21: “**You shall not murder**” is from the decalogue, and it does not prohibit every form of killing. The term used for **murder** has to do with criminal killing. It’s clear from other teachings in Scripture that capital punishment, just warfare, accidental homicide, and self-defense are excluded. The commandment is against the intentional killing for purely personal reasons, whatever those reasons might be. (MacArthur)

5:21: (<u>Rabbinical definition of murder</u>) As in most cultures and religions, the rabbinical tradition defined **murder** as strictly limited to the act of physically taking another person’s life. Jesus had already warned that God’s righteousness “surpasses that of the scribes and the Pharisees” (v. 20). As the chosen custodians of God’s Word, they should have known that God commands heart-righteousness, not just external, legalistic behavior. But the rabbinical interpretation obscured the divinely intended meaning. (MacArthur)

5:21: (<u>Punishment reduced by the rabbinical teaching</u>) Although the commandment, **though shall not murder**, is Scriptural, the penalty (**“shall be liable to court**”) fell short of the biblical standard because it did not prescribe the penalty of death. The rabbis confined murder to a merely civil issue, prosecuted by a human court; and they confined its evil to the physical act. (MacArthur)

5:22: (<u>**Anger** is the source</u>) Jesus attacks the self-confidence of people who are certain that are innocent of murder, because the first step of murder is **anger**. To one degree or another, it makes all men would-be murderers.
It is possible for a model, law-abiding citizen to be as guilty of murder as anyone on death row. It is possible for a person to have more of a murderous spirit that a multiple killer. Many people, in the deepest feelings of their hearts, have anger and hatred to such a degree that their true desire is for the hated person to be dead. At the same time, other feelings may be preventing them from doing that: fear, cowardice, lack of opportunity, [or even pride].
(MacArthur)

5:22: **But I say to you**. Jesus contrasts His teaching not with the OT, but with the rabbinical tradition. He told people God’s truth on the matter. (MacArthur)

5:22: **liable to judgment**. Jesus uses the same phrase He had used in the previous verse to indicate that, since the very same punishment is applicable to **anger**, the guilt itself is also identical. Murder is prefigured by anger and is preceded by anger; therefore, anger, being the source, makes the person **guily**, even though the physical act hasn’t been committed.
It is the thoughts of heart, not the acts of the hand, that is God’s foremost concern (Ps 51:6: “you delight in truth in gthe inward being”; 1 Sam 16:7: “the LORD looks on the heart”).

5:22: **Angry**. Jesus says that if a person is angry, hates, curses, or maligns another person, — he is guilty of murder (!) and deserves a murderer’s punishment. 
John teaches the same truth: “Everyone who hates his brother is a murderer” (1 Jn 3:15).
(MacArthur)

5:22: (<u>the story of Two-Gun Crowley</u>) In the spring of 1931 one the most notorious criminals of that day was captured. Known as Two-gun Crowley, he had brutally murdered a great many people, including several policemen, to whom he had great hatred since childhood.
His girlfriend notified the police about his whereabouts after seeing Crowley with another woman.
To hunt him down, the police has gathered a force of 300 officers armed with rifles, machine guns, and tear gas, outside the an apartment building. They exchanged fire for nearly two hours, until he was finally arrested.
It is said that the police found a blood-spattered note on him that read, “Under my coat is a weary heart, but a kind one; one that would do nobody any harm”. Such an obvious self-deceit seems absurd, yet that is exactly what’s natural to us: “I may have done some bad things, but down deep, I’m not really bad”. 
Crowley was executed one year later upon a court’s decision. He was 19.
(MacArthur)

5:22: (перевод) Весной 1931-го, в США, был задержан один из самых известных преступников своего времени. Известный как Двуствольный Кроули, он хладнокровно убил множество людей, включая несколько полицейских, к которым он питал ненависть с детства.
Однажды полиция получила наводку о его месте пребывания: девушка Кроули сдала его, потому что видела его с другой женщиной. Чтобы задержать его, полиция собрала три сотни офицеров, вооружённых винтовками, пулемётами, и слезоточивым газом. Находясь в квартире своей девушки, Кроули отстреливался целых два часа, прежде чем сдаться.
Говорят, что у него в кармане была найдена окровавленная записка, гласившая: “По моей одеждой живёт усталое, но доброе сердце; сердце, которое не желает никому зла”. 
Такое очевидное само-оправдание кажется абсурдным, но это именно то, что свойственно нам, людям: оправдывать себя и своё поведение, желая убедить себя, что может быть, я и натворил в своей жизни делов, но глубоко внутри, я на самом деле не плохой человек.
Год спустя, Кроули был приговорён к смертной казни, и приговор привели к исполнение. Ему было 19 лет.
(Джон МакАртур + Wikipedia)

5:22: (<u>Godly **anger**</u>) Jesus did not prohibit every form of anger; it is possible to have **righteous anger** against certain things. Moreover, there are things for which we have no excuse for *not* being angry: many of the trends of our society, many of the philosophies and standards to which our children are exposed, and some of the unbiblical teachings within christianity that attach the kingdom and glory of God. Anger about God being dishonored is Godly anger. (MacArthur)

5:22: (<u>Ungodly **anger**</u>) Jesus is talking here about selfish **anger**: anger against a **brother**, whoever that might be, because he has done something against us, or simply displeases us. (MacArthur)

5:22: **Angry** (Gk. *orgizo*): be angry, as expressing a "fixed anger" (settled opposition). It has to do with brooding, simmering anger that is nurtured and not allowed to die. Determined opposition. It is a holding of a grudge, a smoldering bitterness that refuses to forgive. It is the anger that cherishes resentment and does not want reconciliation. Such **anger**, Jesus says, is a form of murder. (MacArthur + HELPS Word-studies)

5:22: **Raca** (Gk. Raca): empty-headed. This term expressed contempt for a man's head, viewing him as stupid. Empty, foolish. (HELPS Word-studies)

5:22: **Raca**. A term of malicious abuse, derision, slander, and arrogant contempt. Variously rendered as: brainless idiot, worthless fellow, silly fool, empty head, blockhead, and the like. (MacArthur)

5:22: A Jewish legend tells of a young rabbi Simon, who was very arrogant. As he basked his feelings of erudition, wisdom, and holiness, he passed a man who was especially unattractive. When the man greeted SImon, the rabbi responded: “You **Raca**! How ugly you are. Are all men of your town as ugly as you?” — “That I do not know,” the man answered, “but go and tell the Maker who created me how ugly is the creature He has made.” (MacArthur)

5:22: **To slander** a creature made in God’s image is to slander God Himself and is equivalent to murdering that person. Contempt, says Jesus, is murder of the heart, and such a person **shall be guilty before the Sanhedrin**, the council of the seventy who tried the most serious offenses. (MacArthur)

5:22: **Fool** (Gk. *moros*) means stupid, dull, and the term from which we get *moron*. Used of an obstinate, godless person, lacking a grip of reality. The prohibition is not about showing a person his foolishness (lack of understanding), but against slanderously calling a person **a fool** out of anger and hatred. Such an expression of malicious animosity is tantamount to murder and makes us **guilty enough to go into the fiery hell**. (MacArthur)

5:22: (three attitudes) **Angry. **Anger is a selfish state of unforgiveness. **Raca**.** **Insulting a person created in God’s image. **You fool.** A condemning character. All of the above is evil and dangerous. 
To be **angry** is the basic evil behind murder. To **slander** a person is even more serious because it gives expression to that anger. To **condemn** a person’s character is more slanderous still: same as cursing and murdering him. (MacArthur)

5:22: **Gehenna**: the Hinnom valley just southwest of Jerusalem used as the city dump. A forbidding place where trash was continually burned and where the fire, smoke, and stench never ceased.
In the valley, King Ahaz had “burned his sons in fire” (2 Chron 28:3) and erected an altar to Molech, on which human sacrifice had sometimes been offered. It would later be called “the valley of Slaughter” (Jer 19:6). King Josiah tore down the altars and turned the valley into the garbage incinerator. The name of the valley therefore came to be a metonym for the place of eternal torment, and was so used by Jesus 11 times.
(MacArthur)

5:23: Jesus calls us to go and **be reconciled** with our **brother** not only when they have wronged us, but even if they think that we have wronged them. Whenever **a brother has something against you**, objectively or subjectively, it is us who need to be the first to exhibit the desire for a **reconciliation**, and act accordingly.

5:23: (<u>The effect on our worship of God</u>) As long as there is internal sin, outward acts of worship are not acceptable to God. Jesus continues to focus on the particular sin of hatred against someone else. Reconciliation must precede worship: sin causes a breach in one’s relationship with God, and the offerings that are intended to restore a right relationship with Him are empty in such a situation. Unresolved conflict has priority and must be settled: not to do so is to be a hypocrite by asking for forgiveness from God without actually repenting. (MacArthur)

5:23: The phrase **your brother has something against you** could mean that even if we are holding nothing against him, if he is angry with or hates us, we should do everything in our power to be reconciled to him. Regardless of who is responsible for the break in relationship, we should determine to make a reconciliation before we come to God to worship. (MacArthur)

5:25: (<u>The effect on our relations with others</u>) This verse is essentially a commentary on the previous one. The time for reconciliation is always now. Tomorrow is often too late. We are not to allow bitterness or any other sin to keep us separated from other people. (MacArthur)

5:25: **To be put in prison** is an analogy of God’s punishment. (MacArthur)




















#### Lust

5:27-30: (<u>the flow of the Sermon on the Mount</u>) Jesus continues to unmask the self-righteous externalism typified by the scribes and Pharisees by showing that the only righteousness acceptable to God is purity of heart. Without that purity, the outward life makes no difference. God’s divine evaluation takes place in the heart. (MacArthur)

5:27: (<u>commandments</u>) Jesus considers two of the commandments. The sixth commandment (“thou shall not kill”) protects the sanctity of life, and the seventh (“**you shall not commit adultery**”) protects the sanctity of marriage. Those who rely on external righteousness break both of those commandments, because in their hearts they attack the sanctity of life and the sanctity of marriage, whether they do so outwardly or not: it’s enough to hate or to lust. (MacArthur)

5:27: (<u>stoning</u>) The Mosaic law portrays **adultery** as one of the most despicable and heinous of sins, punishable by death (Lv 20:10: “both the adulterer and the adulteress shall surely be put to death”; Dt 22:22: “both of them shall die. So you shall purge the evil from Israel.”). In every case, without exception, it is a heinous sin against God. (MacArthur)

5:27: **Adultery** (Gk. *moichao*). It technically refers to sexual intercourse between a man and a woman when one of them is married, but in both the OT and the NEW the word relates to sexual intercourse with anyone other than one’s marriage partner. Although Jesus speaks specifically of adultery here, it seems clear that in a wider sense the term applies to the unmarried as well. (MacArthur)

5:28: (<u>two most powerful</u>) Anger and sexual **lust** are two of the most powerful influences on mankind. The person who gives them reign will soon find that he is more controlled than in control. (MacArthur)

5:28: (<u>sexual culture</u>) Sexual temptations have been strong since man’s fall, but no society in history has had such an increase in the preoccupation and permissiveness of sexual culture as we have today. Like some Corinthian believers (1 Cor 6:13), people tend to think that sex is just a biological act with no moral implications, no different morally from eating or sleeping. (MacArthur)

5:28: **I say to you**. Jesus puts His own word above the authority of revered rabbinic tradition. (MacArthur)

5:28: **Looks**. Present participle, refers to the continuous process of looking. Not an incidental glance, but an intentional and repeated gazing. (MacArthur)

5:28: **To lust for**. Indicates a goal or an intention. The **looking** is done with the purpose of lusting. Jesus is speaking of the man who looks so that he may satisfy his desire. He is speaking of the man who goes to an X-rated movie, who selects a TV program known for its sexual content, who goes to a place known for its display of naked bodies, and who does so with the expectation and desire of being sexually and sinfully titillated (aroused). (MacArthur)

5:28: **Has already committed**. It is not lustful looking that causes the sin in the heart, but the sin in the heart causes lustful looking. The lustful looking is the expression of a heart that is already immoral and adulterous. (MacArthur)

5:28: (<u>nothing new</u>) Jesus did not teach anything new: from the OT times it was clear that sins start in the heart. Take Job 31:1,7-8: “I have made a covenant with my beyes; how then could I gaze at a virgin? if my step has turned aside from the way and my heart has gone after my eyes, ...“. Job new that sin begins in the heart. He therefore determined in advance to guard himself and not to gaze at a woman who might tempt him. (MacArthur)

5:28: (<u>habits</u>) A popular proverb goes: “Sow a thought and reap an act. Sow an act and reap a habit. Sow a habit and reap a character. Sow a character and reap a destiny”. Sin always begins in the mind and heart. 
And just as adulterous heart plans to expose itself to lust-satisfying situations, the godly heart plans to avoid. Both hearts prepare in advance: one indulges itself in advance, the other protects itself in advance. (MacArthur)

5:29: Drastic measures are necessary: it is better to lose something, and be removed from temptation, rather than be exposed to it.

5:29: No sin is committed at once. Long before a sin is committed, there is a heart that was either unprepared, or worse, has dwelt on the thought of coming to that point.
No adultery is committed all of a sudden. Long before adultery is actually committed, there was a man who let himself approach a woman he finds himself attracted to, and lets the situation develop to a point where he does not want to resist anymore. 
And this happens because he hasn’t prepared his mind well in advance. Because he has not learned God’s truth, has not dwelt on righteousness, and has not made up his mind in advance.

5:29-30: An **eye causing you to sin** stands for the sins of perception; the **hand causing you to sin** stands for the sins of action.

5:29: **Вырвать** соблазняющий глаз нужно не рукой, а волей. Кто не смотрит на то, что соблазняет, тот уже вырвал у себя соблазняющий глаз. (Православный Катехизис Филаретовский)

5:29: See note on Mt 4:1 for Polemon's recipe for struggles with temptation ("scorpion in a bottle").

5:29: (<u>Victorian view</u>) Throughout history, some Christians have concluded that sex itself is evil and should be completely condemnded and avoided. This philosophy is commonly referred to today as the Victorian view. It is unbiblical.(MacArthur)

5:29: (<u>extremes</u>) Origen (AD 185-254), one of the outstanding early church fathers, was so convicted of his own sinfulness by reading this passage that he had himself castrated.
Saint Anthony sought to escape immorality and lived in a desert for 35 years, in poverty and deprivation. Yet by his own testimony, he was never freed in all that time from the cares and temptations, because his heart was still in the world and could not escape the world. He quickly discovered that satan, the god of this world, had no difficulty finding him in the desert.
Getting rid of harmful influences will not change a corrupt heart into a pure heart. Outward actions itself cannot produce inner benefits, but when done out of a pure motive, they reflect a pure heart and help it seek God’s will.
(MacArthur)

5:29: In Jewish culture, **the right eye** and **right hand** represented a person’s best and most precious faculties: one’s best vision, and one’s best skills. (MacArthur)

5:29: How the **plucking** of one **right eye** help? Obviously, Jesus is speaking figuratively of the things that make us more susceptible to temptation. We should be willing to give up whatever is necessary, even the most cherished things we possess, if doing that will help protect us from evil. Nothing is so valuable as to be worth preserving at the expense of righteousness. (MacArthur)

5:29: **Causes to you sin/stumble** (Gk. *skandalizo*) basically means to cause to fall. In its substantive form (as here) was often used of the bait stick that springs the trap when an animal touches it. (MacArthur)

5:29: **Pluck it out**. Anything that morally or spiritually traps us, that causes us to fall into sin or to stay in sin, should be eliminated quickly and totally. The message of the hyperbolic statement is that sin must be dealt with radically. (MacArthur)




















#### Divorce

5:31-32: (<u>the flow of the Sermon on the Mount</u>) Jesus continues to correct the perversions of the rabbinical tradition, which accommodated for the desires of the people to lower God’s standard to their own sinful needs, and is bringing people back to the understanding of the Law as it was given in the OT.

5:31: (<u>partial quotation</u>) Partially quoting Dt 24:1, where the woman “finds no favor in [her husband’s] eyes because he has found some indecency in her”. Jesus did not quote that part, because the rabbis who taught on divorce have been teaching that divorce was permissible *on any grounds*. They either did not quote that part about indecency, or interpreted it in such a was that any displeasure would count for indecency.

5:31: (<u>rabbinic teaching</u>) **It was said**. In Jesus’ day, the dominant rabbinic position was that divorce (and remarriage) was permissible on any grounds, and **the certificate** was the only requirement. Divorce had become so easy and casual that a man could dismiss his wife for such trivial things as burning his meal or embarrassing him in front of his friends. Often the husband did not bother to give a reason, since none was required. (MacArthur)

5:31: (<u>old testament</u>) The rabbinic justification for such easy **divorce** was based on an erroneous interpretation of Dt 24:1-4. The focus of that passage is not the question of whether or not divorce is permitted: it does not provide for divorce, much less command it. It shows how improper divorce leads to adultery, which results in defilement. A woman is defiled because of the adultery brought about by her second marriage. Moses is saying, then, that the divorce for indecency or promiscuity creates an adulterous situation. (MacArthur)

5:31: (<u>old testament: indecency</u>) In Dt 24:1, the literal rendering of **indecency** is “the nakedness of a thing”. Some interpret it as repeated indecent exposure. It actually means every kind of improper, shameful, or indecent behavior unbecoming to a woman and embarrassing to her husband. It cannot refer to adultery, because death was the penalty for that. 
It must have been sins of unfaithfulness and promiscuity that stopped just short of actual adultery. And the verse did not allow a divorce in such a situation; Moses is actually saying that the divorce for indecency or promiscuity creates an adulterous situation where a woman becomes defiled if she was divorced because of a mere indecency. (MacArthur)

5:31: **The certificate**. The **certificate** did not make the** divorce** right, but only gave the woman some protection: it protected her reputation from slander and provided proof of her legal freedom from her former husband and her consequent right to remarry. (MacArthur)

5:31: (<u>divorce permissible</u>) Through Moses, God recognized and permitted **divorce** as an accommodation of His grace for human sin (Mt 19:3: “Is it lawful to divorce one's wife for any cause?”; Mt 19:8: “Because of your hardness of heart Moses allowed you to divorce your wives, but from the beginning it was not so”). God never commanded divorce but only permitted it as a concession to sinful, self-willed mankind. (MacArthur)

5:32: **Adultery**. Jesus affirms what Moses taught in Dt 24:1-4: that unjustified divorce inevitably leads to adultery. By allowing a no-fault divorce, the keepers of the law have caused a bight of adultery to contaminate God’s people. (MacArthur)

5:32: Jesus confronted them with a proper interpretation of God’s law. He said that every time a man without proper cause turned his wife loose to remarry, he forced her into adultery, which made him guilty also. In addition, the man who married the former wife and the woman who married the former husband were likewise guilty of adultery. Jesus’ whole point is that divorce leads to adultery. (MacArthur)

5:32: **Except on the ground of sexual immorality.** This condition is not a way out that God provides, but is the only grounds for divorce that He will recognize. Marriage was never meant to be separated (Mt 19:6: “what therefore God has joined together, let no man separate”); adultery, another reality that God never intended, is the only thing that can break the bond of marriage. 
That’s not a change of the OT law. In the OT, adultery would necessarily dissolve a marriage, because the guilty party was put to death. (MacArthur)

5:32: **Divorce** is never commanded, but is permissible as a last resort: to be used only when unrepentant immorality had exhausted the patience of the innocent spouse, and the guilty one would not be restored. God hates divorce, but He allows  (MacArthur)




















#### Oaths

5:33-37: (<u>the flow of the Sermon on the Mount</u>) Jesus continues to correct the perversions of the rabbinical tradition, which accommodated for the desires of the people to lower God’s standard to their own sinful needs, and is bringing people back to the understanding of the Law as it was given in the OT.

5:33: (deception in our society) **Swear**. Mutual mistrust (“credibility gap”) is one of the major marks of the world system where the prince is satan, “the father of lies” (Jn 8:44). We shade the truth, we cheat, we exaggerate, we misrepresent income tax deductions, we make promises we have no intention of keeping, we make up excuses, and betray confidences, — all as a matter of normal, everyday living. So much of business, politics, government, science, religion, and even family life is built of falsehoods and half-truths. Individually, men are inclined to the truth only when it benefits them. (MacArthur)

5:33: (**oaths** by God) In the OT there are several occasions on which God has made an **oath** — obviously, not because His word would otherwise be questionable or unreliable, but because He wished to impress upon men a special importance related to the promise. (MacArthur)

5:33: (**oaths** by men) **An oath** invoking the name of someone greater than the person making the oath is supposed to give greater credibility to what it said. Any oath calling God invites Him to witness the truthfulness and to avenge if it is a lie. It is a man’s device to communicate their truthfulness in the single specific case.
Obviously, an oath, no matter how strong the words used, is only as reliable as the one who makes it (for example: Mt 26:72: “peter denied it with an oath”). 
(MacArthur) 

5:34-35: **By heaven, by the earth, by Jerusalem**. By OT law, oaths were to be made only in God’s name (Dt 6:13: “God you shall fear. Him you shall serve and by his name you shall swear.”), even Gentiles. Knowing that, people routinely swore by heaven, by earth, by the Temple, by the hairs on their heads, and by any other thing they thought would impress those they wanted to take advantage of. By those who practiced it, it was considered to be perfectly acceptable as long as it was not in the name of the Lord. Rabbinical tradition conveniently interpreted Num 30:2 that violating any other oath was permissible to accommodate the sinful, selfish purposes of the people who wanted to lie. (MacArthur) 

5:34-35: In Mt 23:21-22 (swearing by heaven, swearing by the Temple) Jesus’s point is that to carelessly and dishonestly call any part of His creation as witness to a false oath was to dishonor God Himself, whether or not His name was invoked. **Heaven**, **earth**, **Jesuralem**, and every person’s **head** is God’s, and it is therefore wicked and sinful to use any part of His creation as witness to anything that is deceitful or dishonest. Prov 12:22: “lying lips are an abomination to the Lord”. (MacArthur)

5:34: **Do not take an oath at all**. In light of OT passages approving oaths, and Him not coming to abolish the law, it can hardly be correct, as many interpret this passage, that Jesus here forbids the making of any oath under any circumstance. In accordance with the OT, we are to swear by no other name but God’s. The greatest error in the system was in its basic deceptiveness, and this is what Jesus is speaking against.

5:37: **Yes, yes. No, no**. Christian character has to be of such an integrity that every word is true even without an oath, and every **yes** can be trusted to be a true **yes**, and every **no** really means **no**. Jesus commends simple truthfulness in thought, word and deed.




















#### Retaliation

5:38-43: (<u>the flow of the Sermon on the Mount</u>) Jesus continues to correct the rabbinical tradition which has come to a point where it allowed personal retaliation. Which is against both the OT and the NT. (MacArthur)

5:38: This OT concept (Dt 19:21) was not about personal revenge but the execution of justice by the authorities. The phrase means that the punishment of the guilty must be in proportion to the crime (John Strohman)

5:38: **An eye for an eye, and a tooth for a tooth**. An OT principle of *lex talionis*: that punishment should exactly match the crime. Same idea is carried in the expression *quid pro quo*. The purpose was to 1) curtail further crime (Dt 19:20: “the rest will hear and be afraid”); and to 2) prevent excessive punishment: a selfish overreaction, the type of which Lamech boasted (Gen 4:23-24: “i killed a man for wounding me”). That’s because human vengeance is never satisfied with justice; it wants a pound of flesh for an ounce of offence. (MacArthur)

5:38: **Eye for an eye**. The principle has been often wrongly viewed throughout history as a mandate for vengeance. (MacArthur)

5:38: (<u>no retaliation allowed; but care of your enemies</u>) **Eye for an eye**. In all three accounts, the principle has to do with the civil justice system. God does not allow humans to avenge themselves, but restricts vengeance to Himself: “vengeance is Mine, and retribution” (Dt 32:35). God’s command for the individual has always been, “If your enemy is hungry, give him bread to eat, and if he is thirsty, give him water to drink” (Prov 25:21). No individual has the right to “do to him as he has done to me” (Prov 24:29: “do not say” this). (MacArthur)

5:39: **Do not resist**. We are not to retaliate (**eye for an eye**), but to forgive. It is our personal responsibility; it is the requirement of the government to execute justice (Rom 13:1-7). Never take revenge (Rom 12:19-21). Jesus "did not revile", "uttered no threats" (1 Pet 2:23). This personal non-retaliatory concept is not to be confused with standing by while evil is directed against others. (John Strohman)

5:39: **Do not resist**. The only person who is non-defensive and never bears a grudge is the person who has died to self. To fight for one’s rights is to prove that self is still on the throne of the heart. (MacArthur)

5:39: **Do not resist him who is evil**. Jesus does **not** teach, as many have claimed, that no stand is to be taken against evil, and that it should simply be allowed to take its course. Jesus and the apostles continually opposed evil with every means and resource (the cleansing of the temple; “resist the devil” in Jas 4:7; exorcism done by Paul in Acts 16:16; “why did you strike Me?” by Jesus in Jn 18:23; “you yourself violate the law by commanding that I be struck” said by Paul in Acts 23:3;  ...more examples?). Jesus, however, never resisted any evil directed at Himself. He prayed, “forgive them, for they do not know what they are doing” (Lk 23:34).
(MacArthur)

5:39: **Do not resist him who is evil.** From many passages in the NT it is clear that this principle does not apply to governmental authorities, for they “do not bear the sword for nothing” (Rom 13:4). Judges and magistrates are God’s instruments for preserving law and order by being a terror to evil. (MacArthur)

5:39-42: **Do not resist.** After establishing the basic principle of non-retaliation, Jesus picks out four basic human rights that He uses to illustrate this principle: dignity (a slap on the cheek), security (take your tunic), liberty (go that extra mile), and property (give to the one who asks). (MacArthur)

5:39: A **slap** is not an act of violence, but an insignificant insult, or a violation of one's rights (AMP). It was a great insult in Jewish culture (John Strohman)

5:39: **A slap**. Among Jews, a **slap** or other striking in the face was an attack on one’s honor and was considered a terrible indignity. Even a slave would rather receive whipping than be slapped in the face. (MacArthur)

5:39: **Turn to him the other also**. Jesus’ point is in what we are *not* to do. Turning the other cheek symbolizes the non-avenging, non-retaliatory, humble and gentle spirit that is to characterize kingdom citizens. We are not to defend out dignity by retaliation. (MacArthur)

5:39: Готовность терпеть человека и значит подставить вторую щёку. И идти второе поприще. (Авксентий)

5:39: Подставь другую щёку? Это вообще как? Господи, я не могу! Да, ты не можешь. Но Бог поможет. Что же теперь, ходить всем щёки подставлять? Нет; но если придётся, если будет ситуация, подставляй. (Андроник Пантак)

5:39: **Подставь другую щёку**. Здесь Христос на самом деле не говорит ничего нового, а повторяет учение ветхого завета: "подставляет ланиту свою биющему его, пресыщается поношением, ибо не навек оставляет Господь." (Плач 3:30-31)

5:40: **His tunic**. Rightfully his. When someone takes what’s rightfully yours, **resisting** such a person, **an evil person**, is a natural reaction of a selfish human nature. And when our supreme concern is getting and keeping what we think is rightfully ours, everything that gets in the way becomes expendable. Including the law. (MacArthur)

5:40: **His tunic**. A **tunic** was worn as an undergarment, and the **cloak** was an outer garment that also served as a blanket at night. Most people owned only one coat and probably one or two tunics. It was the **cloak** that Mosaic law required be returned to its owner “before the sun sets, for that is his only covering; it is his cloak for his body” (Ex 22:26-27). (MacArthur)

5:40: **Let him have your cloak**. The extremely valuable outer garment, which could not be demanded by the court of law, should be surrendered voluntarily, rather than causing offense with an adversary. We should be willing to offer even more in order to show our regret for any wrong we did, and to show that we are not bitter or resentful. In doing so, we will show the love of Christ. (MacArthur)  

5:41: **Forces you**. Kingdom citizens are to be willing to sacrifice their liberty. Like all other rights, freedom is not to be cherished and protected at the expense of righteousness. (MacArthur)

5:41: **Forces you to go one mile**. Roman law gave a soldier the right to **force** a civilian to carry his pack for a *milion*, a Roman **mile**, which was slightly shorter than our modern mile. Being the oppressors, Roman soldiers were never more hated than when they forced someone to carry their pack. (MacArthur)

5:41: **Go with him two miles**. Even with so despised a burden, we should carry it willingly. And we should surrender even more of our liberty rather than retaliate. In doing so, we are obedient to our Lord and testify to His righteousness. (MacArthur)

5:42: **The one who begs**. The implication is that the person has a genuine need. We are not to respond to every foolish, selfish request made of us. Sometimes to give a person what he wants but does not need is a disservice, doing him more harm than good. (MacArthur)




















#### Love Your Enemies

5:43-48: (<u>the flow of the Sermon on the Mount</u>) This is the 6-th, and the last, illustration contrasting the false righteousness of the scribes and Pharisees with the true righeousness of God. Nowhere was it more evident how their religion was corrupted and different from God's. (MacArthur)

5:43: (<u>Love in the OT</u>) **You shall love your neighbor**. Lev 19:18 requires that "you shall love your neighbor *as yourself*": a love for others that's shown in sympathetic concern and actual care for them. But God had never had a double standard of righteousness: Dt 22:1-4 taught Israelites to help their fellow countrymen if their animals were lost, but also commanded to do the same favors for the enemy. The **neighbor** of the commandment was anyone in need whom an Israelite might come across (Lk 10:30-37: "Who is my neighbor?"). Furthermore, Job says that rejoicing when harm comes to an enemy is sin (Job 31:29-30: "Have I rejoiced at the extinction of my enemy? ... No, I have not allowed my mouth to sin by asking for his life in a curse"). David mourned and prayed when his enemy was sick as if it was his friend or brother (Ps 35:12-15). (MacArthur)

5:43: Again we see the Pharisees mixing some truth with a lie. The truth was "**love your neighbor**" (Lev 18:19); the lie was "**hate your enemy**". Note how they omitted "as yourself". It is one thing to say that you love someone, and it is another thing to love that person with the same concern you have for yourself. (John Strohman)

5:43: By teaching like that, followed by "**hate**", the Pharisees changed the understanding of that commandment completely, perverting the sort of **love** originally meant by God, where a **neighbor** is anyone we have contact with in our daily life. Not loving a neighbor is not merely a flaw; it says one is a child of the devil (1 Jn 3:10; 4:20). (John Strohman)

5:43: **hate.** Lev 19:18 actually prohibits taking vengeance, or even holding a grudge. The only way not to hold a grudge is to forgive them. Also see Ex 23:4-5, which urges to actually help your enemies  (John Strohman)

5:43: (<u>The perversion of rabbinic tradition</u>) **Love your neighbor, and hate your enemy**. Love, said the ancients, was to be reserved for those you get along with. Enemies were to be hated. 
Satan's perversions of God's revelation almost always touches on the truth at some point: then it's more believable.
Rabbinical tradition omitted the *as yourself* part. As with other scriptural standards that seemed too demanding, the one concerning love of neighbor was reduced to a humanly acceptable level.
The addition of **hate your enemy** was even more perverse. It is little wonder that the Romans charged Jews with hatred of the human race, for one saying of the Pharisees read: "If a Jew sees a Gentile fallen into the sea, let him by no means lift him out, for it is written, 'Thou shalt not rise up against the blood of thy neighbor,', but this man is not thy neighbor". The idea that Gentiles were to be personally despised and hated originated from pride and self-righteousness. (MacArthur)

5:43: (<u>The balance of love and justice</u>) Godly attitude toward even the worst pagans is to love them and pray that they will turn to God and be saved, but we also pray that if they do not turn to Him, God will judge them and remove them to prepare the way for Jesus Christ. We are to share God's own balance of love and justice. 
But the Pharisees had no such balance. They had no love for justice, but only for vengeance. 
(MacArthur)

5:44: **But I say to you**. In placing what He said above what tradition said, Jesus placed His word on a par with Scripture, as His hearers well understood. 
Jesus did not quote scripture, but taught, placing an emphasis on His authority to do so: "Your great rabbis have taught you this, but by My own authority, I declare that they have perverted God's truth, which is something else." 
(MacArthur)

5:44: **Love your enemies**. Jesus has probably startled His audience. To the arrogant men masquerading as the custodians of God's law, it must have seemed naive and foolish in the extreme. (MacArthur)

5:44: **Love your enemies**. The human tendency is to base love on what we like or prefer. But true love is need-oriented. The Good Samaritan parable started with a question of *who* is a neighbor, but demonstrated how to *be* a neighbor. Being a neighbor is meeting another's needs. (MacArthur)

5:44: **love**: “that is, unselfishly seek the best or higher good for” (AMP)

5:44: **love**. Greek *agape*: a love that seeks and works to meet another's highest welfare. It *may* involve emotion, but it *must* involve action. Obviously, love must involve attitude, because, like every form of righteousness, it begins in the heart. (MacArthur)

5:44: **love**. Love's question is never whom to love -- because we are to love everyone, -- but only how to love most helpfully. (MacArthur)

5:44: **Love your enemies**. Love indeed sees all the hatefulness and the wickedness of the enemy, feels his stabs and his blows, may even have something to do toward warding them off; but all this simply fills the loving heart with the one desire and aim, to free its enemy from his hate, to rescue him from his sin, and thus to save his soul. (R. C. H. Lenski)

5:44: **persecute you**. Persecution is so often the world's response to God's truth that unmasks people at their most sensitive points where they try to rid themselves of guilt. (MacArthur)

5:44: **pray for those who persecute you**. The best way to have the *agape* love attitude towards **those who persecute** us is to bring them before the Lord in prayer. We could not possibly love them for *what* they do, but we must love them because of *who* they are: sinners fallen from the image of God and in need of God's forgiveness and grace. Just as we were sinners in need of His forgiveness and grace before He saved us. This is the first step towards loving the person. (MacArthur)

5:45: **that you may be sons of your Father who is in heaven**. To love our enemies and to pray for our persecutors is to manifest the greatest evidence of our divine sonship. Loving enemies is so uncharacteristic of human nature that it gives a strong evidence of its heavenly origin. (MacArthur)

5:45: **that you may be**. The aorist tense of **may be** indicates a once and for all established fact. (MacArthur)

5:45: **you may be sons of your Father**. Loving as God loves does not *make* us **sons of the Father**, but gives evidence that we already are His children. When a life reflects God's nature, it proves that is possesses His nature by the new birth. (MacArthur)

5:45: **you may be sons of your Father**. The Master expects from His disciples such conduct as can be explained only in terms of the supernatural. (MacArthur)

5:45: **For He makes His sun rise on the evil and on the good**. The reason for loving your enemies is given in this verse: because God demonstrates His *agape* love in attending to the needs of all people, evil and good alike. Those who refuse God are His enemies; but He is not theirs. In the same way, we are not to be enemies of those who may be enemies to us. They should be neighbors to us. (MacArthur)

5:45: **the evil and the good**. An old rabbinic saying tells of the drowning of the Egyptians in the Red Sea. As the story goes, when the Egyptians were destroyed, the angels began to rejoice; but God lifted up His hand and said, "The work of my hands are sunk in the sea, and you would sing?". (MacArthur)

5:47: **what more are you doing than others?**. The Pharisees were certain that they were far better than everyone else, but Jesus again cuts through their blind hypocrisy, showing that their type of love is nothing more than the ordinary self-centered love common even to **tax-gatherers** and **Gentiles**: to whom the scribes and the Pharisees thought they were most undeniably superior.  (MacArthur)

5:47: **you love those who love you**. "Your righteousness", Jesus charged, "is therefore no better than theirs". This must have outraged the Pharisees. (MacArthur)

5:47: **what more are you doing?**. The citizens of God's kingdom are to have a much higher standard of love than the rest of the world. (MacArthur)

5:48: **Be perfect, as your heavenly Father is perfect**. The sum of all the Scripture: the great purpose of salvation, and the great yearning of the heart of God, is for all men to become like Him. (MacArthur)

5:48: **Perfect** (Gk. *teleios*): to reach an intended end or a completion. Is often translated "mature", but here, the meaning is obviously that of perfection, because the **heavenly Father** is the standard. Absolute perfection. (MacArthur)

5:48: **Be perfect**. That perfection is utterly impossible in man's own power. But that which God demands, He Himself provides the power to accomplish. The impossible righteousness becomes possible for those who trust in Jesus Christ, because He gives them His righteousness. (MacArthur)




















### Chapter 6

6:1-18: (<u>the flow of the Sermon on the Mount</u>) Mt 5:21-48 focuses on *the teaching* of the law: on what men believe; the following verses of 6:1-18 focus on *the practice* of the law, what men do. 
The three representative illustrations that Jesus considered: our religion as it acts towards others (alms); our religion as it acts towards God (praying); our religion as it acts in relation to ourselves (fasting).
(MacArthur)




















#### Giving to the Needy

6:1: **чтобы заметили**. "Вот две женщины моют пол. Одна для того, чтобы 15-го получить зарплату, а вторая, чтобы было чисто.". Пётр Мамонов.

6:1: **to be noticed**. Most people do good deeds so others will think well of them. Some may disagree and claim they do things because it gives them a good feeling inside. They do not realize that in getting that "good feeling" they are still doing good works for an audience who they want to think well of them: the audience is themselves. They want to have the satisfaction of viewing themselves as very altruistic people. Others think that by doing something good they can offset some bad thing they have done. In neither case are they doing service to solely glorify God. (John Strohman)

6:1: (<u>sham religion: rearrange the ashes</u>) **To be noticed**. There is a story of an eastern ascetic holy man who covered himself with ashes as a sign of humility, and regularly sat on a prominent street corner of his city. When tourists asked permission to take his picture, he would rearrange his ashes to give the best image of destitution and humility.
A great deal of religion amounts to nothing more than rearranging religious "ashes" to impress the world with one's supposed humility and devotion. But this devotion is to self, not to God, and such a religion is nothing more than a game of pretense.
(MacArthur)

6:1: **Beware** (Gk. *prosecho*) means to take hold of something and pay attention to it, especially in the sense of being on guard. (MacArthur)

6:1: **To be seen** (Gk. theathēnai) is a term from which we get "theater". It means a spectacle to be gazed at. Jesus warns about **practicing** a form of **righteousness** whose purpose is to show off **before men**. 
Such religion does not demonstrate what is in the minds and hearts of the actors, but is simply a performance designed to make a certain impression on those who are watching. The purpose is to magnify the actors rather than God, and to please men, not God. (MacArthur)

6:2: **When**. Jesus introduces this teaching with **when**, not with *if*, indicating that He expects us to do give alms. (MacArthur)

6:2: **Hypocrisy** is not the Christian's attitude. The Christian does good works out of love for God and is not interested in getting congratulated by others. (John Strohman)

6:2: **Hypocrite** (Gk. hupokrite) originally was a Greek actor who wore a mask that portrayed the role that was being dramatized. It came to be used of anyone pretending to be what he was not. (MacArthur)

6:2: **Hypocrite**. In a church, hypocrisy comes in two forms: nonbelievers masquerading as Christians; and true believers who are sinful but pretend to be spiritual. (MacArthur)

6:2: **Hypocrisy**. John Calvin believed that every virtue is corrupted and polluted by hypocrisy; no virtue is so praiseworthy as to be immune to it.

6:2: **Hypocrisy**. Augustine said, "The love of honor is the deadly bane of true piety. Other vices bring forth evil works, but this brings forth good works in an evil way." Hypocrisy is so dangerous because it is so deceptive. It uses things that are basically good for purposes that are basically evil. (MacArthur)

6:2: **Trumpet**. Some people (Calvin?) say they actually did have a little silver **trumpet**, and they used to go in the streets and the synagogues, and they would blow that little silver trumpet. And it was kind of like "all you poor, come one come all, your great benefactor has arrived". And all the poor would come at the blowing of the little trumpet and the guy would start doling out the money.
We have our own little trumpets. We want to let people know we gave. We go home to our wife and then say, “Boy, what I’ve done for him, you’d think that he could treat me a little different.” And we want to find somebody that we can tell. It’s just that we want our little trumpet. We don’t want a big trumpet, just a little trumpet. 
And then we get appeals from Christian organizations, if you will give us money we’ll send you a certificate for your wall. Now that is a trombone, folks. And then if you want a tuba, you can get a plaque. You can have a whole band in your office blowing all over the place. 
Those Christian organizations offering such certificates appeal to wrong motives, and are themselves wrong, for they put a stumbling block to other Christians (Mt 18:7: "woe to that man through whom the stumbling block comes!").
(MacArthur)

6:2: **Trumpet**. Sometimes we try to make our good works "accidentally" noticed. But even if we only *want* people to notice, and do nothing to attract their attention, our heart motive is to **be honored by men**. The real trumpet blowing, the basic hypocrisy, is on the inside, and that is where God judges. (MacArthur)

6:2: **Reward**. False righteousness does have a reward: the applause of other hypocrites and ignorant people. That, however, is the limit of the honor: God does not reward men-pleasers, because they rob Him of glory. (MacArthur)

6:2: **Reward**. Notice in v.1 that if you boast, you have no reward from God, but in v. 2 **they have their reward**. This v.2 reward is not from your Father who is in heaven. 
Who’s it from? From those you were doing this thing for: from men. If you’re an actor on a stage, if you’re hupokritēs, if you're just doing your thing for the applause of men, what you get is the applause of men. That’s it. You get an earthly reward, not a heavenly one. You get something from men and nothing from God.
(MacArthur)

6:2: (<u>Jewish tradition on salvation through alms</u>.) **Hypocrites give to the needy** to do good works. 
Did you know that in the Apocrypha, for example in Tobit 12:8, it says “It is good to do alms rather than treasure up gold, for *alms deliver from the death and this will purge away every sin*”? The Jews actually taught that they would purge away their sins by giving money to the needy. That’s how far they’ve gone. 
In Sirach 3:30 it says, “Alms will *atone for sin*.” 
I found several quotes out of the Talmud. “Alms giving is more excellent than all offerings and *is equal to the whole law*.” “Alms giving *will deliver from the condemnation of hell and make one perfectly righteous*.”
Now, that’s going a little far, isn’t it? They believed you could get perfectly righteous by giving your money. You see that’s why the Jews believed that the richer you were, the easier it was to get in the kingdom, because you bought your way in. And so, when Jesus said "*it’s easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than a rich man to get into heaven*", it devastated their whole conception, see? Because they thought the rich could buy their way in easy because purging of sin came from giving away money.
By the way, the Roman Catholic Church picked this up. Leo the Great said this, “By prayer we seek to appease God. By fasting we extinguish the lust of the flesh and *by alms we redeem our sins*.” By the way, the Pope who just visited America believes that. That’s part of the system. They made it a saving element. And then they made it an element for piosity. 
Boy, they really put it on as a big display. And Jesus goes right by all of that stuff on the outside and says the only thing God cares about is your heart, not what you did, but why you did it. See? Two people doing the same thing, giving money to a poor man. Why did they do it makes the difference.
(MacArthur)

6:3: <u>Is your almsgiving glorifying you, or God</u>? There is a very big difference. Mt 5:16 teaches that our good works should *glorify God*, not us.  If you are told that something you did was very kind, you should tell that person you did it because you are Christian. This will inform him that your motivation is from Christ and not of your own goodness. The end result will be that Christ is glorified and not yourself. This is a witness to Christ. (John Strohman)

6:3: **Reward**. There is a reward for those who give out of a right heart. In v.2 it went "*they received their reward*". **But**, Jesus goes on, and this says that if you do it differently, you'll have a different result. A reward. 

6:3: **Do not let your left hand know what your right hand is doing**. Something done so easily that you didn't need to employ the other hand to put an effort to.

6:3: **Do not let your left hand know what your right hand is doing**. Because v.4 says such a giving is done *in secret*, Jesus probably means that the act of giving should be done \[by the right hand\] in such a secret and easy way that not even the left hand, its closest partner, would notice.

6:3: **Do not let your left hand know what your right hand is doing**. It was probably a proverbial expression that refers to doing something spontaneously, with no special effort or show. The right hand, being the primary hand of action, does so many things in a normal day's work that would not involve the left hand. Giving to help those in need should be a normal activity of the Christian, and he should do it as simply, directly, and discreetly as possible. (MacArthur)

6:3: **Do not let your left hand know what your right hand is doing**. Some believe it was a Proverb of the time for doing things so spontaneously that you didn’t really think about them. 
You’re walking along the street and here’s somebody with a need. And without a long process of calculation, without a lot of thought and analysis and checking out your bank book or whatever. Here’s a need and you just reach in and you slip it over there.
It’s spontaneous, it’s free, it’s uninhibited. It’s based on the compassion and the mercy of the moment. The left hand isn’t even aware of it. And that’s the essence of what he’s saying. The right hand was usually the active hand, and it gives easily. And your left hand which is down here by your left hip doesn’t even know what’s happening.
And you know what’s kind of nice about it too? If the left hand doesn’t know, the left hand can’t get involved. The left hand isn’t going to say a thing. The idea is the freedom and the spontaneity without calculating it. Just give it. 
You say, “But what am I going to do to make sure?" The Lord will bless. And there is a big joy to just give and not even think about how much or can you afford it. You just respond to the need.
(MacArthur)

6:4: **In secret** (Gk. krypto): concealed.

6:4: **In secret**. But previously in Mt 5:16 Jeses said to "*let your light shine before others*". The question is not whether or not our good works should be *seen* by others, but whether they are done for that end. The difference is in purpose and motivation. (MacArthur)

6:4: **In secret** before others, but of course, no in secret before the person you give to. When the good work is done "in such a way" (v. 3) that attention and glory is focused on our "Father who is in heaven", God is pleased, and we "let our light shine" before that very person. But trying to tell about this act to others is not letting the light shine; it's blowing the trumpet.

6:4: **In secret**. A.B. Bruce gives this helpful explanation: "We are to show when tempted to hide, and hide when tempted to show". (MacArthur)

6:4: **In secret**. Besser said that the temple had a special place where the 'bashful benefactors', he called them, could come. They wanted to give to the poor, but they were bashful. And so, they would just come and they would just put money there. And then there were the bashful poor, who didn’t want to ask, and the bashful poor would come in in another place and they would take what they needed. And the name of the place was the Chamber of the Silent. I love that. Nothing to be said, just needs to be met. (MacArthur)

6:4: **Your Father will reward you**. Giving in the OT is described as a part of God's circle of blessing (Prov 11:25: "the generous man will be prosperous, and he who waters will himself be watered"). As we give, God blesses, and when God blesses us we give again out of what He has given. (MacArthur)

6:4: **And your Father who sees in secret will reward you.**. The principle is this: if we remember, God will forget; but if we forget, God will remember. Our purpose should be to meet every need we are able to meet, and leave the bookkeeping to God. (MacArthur)




















#### On Prayer

6:5-8: (<u>the flow of the Sermon on the Mount</u>) Jesus continues His contrast of true and false righteousness. He exposed the hypocritical giving, will expose their hypocritical fasting, and now He exposes an equally hypocritical praying, as typified by the scribes and Pharisees. (MacArthur)

6:5: (<u>Calvinist and Arminian view on prayer</u>) **Pray**. None of us can comprehend how prayer functions within the infinite mind and plan of God. Two extreme views:
<u>Calvinist view</u>: God is sovereign, and He works according to His perfect will regardless of the way we pray. Prayer is nothing more than tuning in to God's will; a way of lining up with God regarding what He has already determined to do.
<u>Arminian view</u>: God's actions pertaining to us are determined largely on the basis of our prayers. Prayer is beseeching God to do what He otherwise would not do.
Scripture supports both views and holds them in tension: it declares God's absolute sovereignty, but it also calls on His people to beseech Him in prayer. It is not possible to fathom what makes prayer effective.
(MacArthur)

6:5: **They pray.** No other race or people has ever been so favored by God or had such direct communication with Him. Of all people, they should have known how to pray. But they did not. (MacArthur)

6:5: (<u>Errors in the rabbinic tradition</u>) **They pray.** Over the years, a number of faults have crept into Jewish prayer life. <cut />
1. Prayer had become ritualized: the wording and forms of prayer were set, and were then simply read or repeated from memory. Such prayers could be given with almost no attention being paid to what was said. They were a routing, semiconscious religious exercise.
A faithful Jew would recite [Dt 6:4-9, then Dt 11:13-21, then Num 15:37-41](https://www.esv.org/Deuteronomy+6:4%E2%80%939;Deuteronomy+11:13%E2%80%9321;Numbers+15:37%E2%80%9341/). Another formalized prayer was [the Amidah (or the Shemoneh Esreh)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amidah), which embodied 18 prayers. Each morning, afternoon, and evening, at the appointed time, the devout Jew would stop what he was doing and offered one appropriate prayer from it.
Some people prayed it honestly, with a worshipful heart. Others went through the ritual as fast as possible, in order to finish. Some Pharisees used it as an opportunity to parade their piosity.
2. There were prescribed prayers for every object an occasion: light, fire, rain, new moon, travelling, good news, bad news, and so on. No doubt the original intention was to bring every aspect of life into the presence of God, but by making the prayers prescribed and formalized, that purpose was undermined.
3. Prayer was limited to specific times and occasions. 
4. Long prayers were esteemed, believing that its sanctity and effectiveness depended on its length. Ancient rabbis maintained that the longer the prayer, the more likely it would be heard. Length was confused with sincerity.
5. Meaningless repetitions, patterned after those of pagan religions. Jews often added adjective after adjective  before God's name in their prayers.
6. The worst fault was that of wanting to be seen and heard by others. While other faults are not necessarily wrong in themselves, this one is intrinsically evil, because it came from pride, and was intended to satisfy pride.
(MacArthur; quoting William Barclays) 

6:5: **Be not like the hypocrites**. Prayer that focuses on self is always hypocritical, because, by definition, the focus of every prayer should be on God. But the purpose of a hypocrite is to attract attention and bring honor to themselves. (MacArthur)

6:5: **Hypocrites**. The greatest danger to religion is when a person does not change, but simply becomes religious. The old nature in religious wrappings. (MacArthur)

6:5: **Street corners**. Unlike v. 2, where the word *rhume* refers to a narrow street, the *plateia* here refers to a wide street. (MacArthur)

6:5: **Street corners**. There was nothing wrong with praying in the street if that was where you happened to stop at the time for prayer. But something's very much wrong if you *planned* to be there at prayer time. This is probably what Jesus talks about. (MacArthur)

6:5: **That they may be seen.**. The primary concern of the Pharisees was for others to see them engaging in religious acts. Their view of prayer was that it could be used as a vehicle to have others think well of them. **They have their reward in full**: They have achieved their goal, but their prayers were of no spiritual benefit, and will not be heard nor answered, since they did not pray in faith (John Strohman)

6:5: **That they may be seen.** The real evil was not the place, but the desire to display themselves. They preferred to pray in those places where the largest audiences were. (MacArthur)

6:5: **They have received their reward**. This tells us that God is not going to heed such a prayer.

6:6: **Shut the door**. Some believers overreact and renounce all public prayer, but Jesus taught no such thing: He Himself often prayed in the presence of His disciples, and blessed the food in public. Scripture also records many public prayers that were entirely appropriate and sincere. (MacArthur)

6:6: **Go into your room**. Unlike the public prayer of the hypocrites, go to the most private place you can find so you will not be tempted to show off. Do whatever you have to get your attention away from yourself and others. (MacArthur)

6:6: **In secret**. Jesus regularly went away from His disciples to pray entirely alone, and so much of our prayer life should be. (MacArthur)

6:6: **In secret**. Jesus' point has to do with the singleness of intention. True prayer is always intimate. Even prayer in public, the heart should be right and concentrated on God. (MacArthur)

6:6: **In secret**. Chrysostom reported that in his day (the 4-th century A.D.) many Christians prayed so loud in their rooms that everyone down the hall heard what they said :D (MacArthur)

6:6: **Your Father who sees in secret**. These verses continue the theme Jesus set out in previous sections. The point is that our relationship with God is not built on external actions but our heart attitude while doing external actions (or private actions for that matter). (John Strohman)

6:6: **Sees in secret**. The most important secret He sees is not the words we say, but the thoughts we have in the privacy of our heart. Those are the secrets with which God is supremely concerned. (MacArthur)

6:6: **Will reward you**. When God is genuinely the audience of our prayer, we will have the reward only He can give. He will bless those who come to Him in sincerity. Jesus gave no idea as to what reward is in view. (MacArthur)

6:7: **Heap up empty phrases** (Gk. battalogeo: idle, thoughtless chatter). Although it does not always involve hypocrisy, it always involves a wrong attitude. Such people are simply indifferent to real communion with God. (MacArthur)

6:7: **Repetition** may be used by people 1) to display piety; 2) because others taught they so; 3) because it's easy and demands little concentration. (MacArthur)

6:7: **Empty phrases**. To be acceptable to God, prayers must be genuine expressions of worship and of heartfelt petitions. (MacArthur)

6:7: **They will be heard for their many words**. The Jews had picked up the practice from Gentiles, or their practice had not more effect than that of the Gentiles. 

6:7: **As the Gentiles do**. The Gentiles thought that you had to appease and persuade a God to help you, or even to intimidate or irritate. (MacArthur)

6:7: **Repetition**. Again, Jesus did not forbid the repetition of genuine requests. See Lk 18:2-7: The Parable of the Persistent Widow. Paul prayed three times about the thorn (2 Cor 12:7-8). Jesus cried out three times about the cup (Mt 26:39-44). It is only mindless, indifferent recital that is wrong. (MacArthur)

6:8: **Your Father knows what you need**. "By our praying ... we are instructing ourselves more than we are Him" (Martin Luther). The purpose of our prayer is not to inform God, but to come before Him sincerely, purposely, consciously, and devotedly. (John Stott) (MacArthur; quoted)

6:8: **Your Father knows what you need**. To pray rightly is to pray with a devout heart and with pure motives. With a single attention to God. And with a sincere confidence that He both hears and answers every request made to Him in faith. He always repays our sincere devotion with gracious response. If our request is sincere but not according to His will, He will answer in a way better than we want or expect. But He will always answer. (MacArthur)

6:9-13: Jesus gave us an outline. 9. In reverent praise. 10. For the coming **kingdom**. 11. For **daily** provision. 12. For spiritual protection by being **deliver**ed **from evil**. 13. For **forgive**ness of our sins, for the forgiveness of others. (John Strohman) 




















#### The Lord's Prayer

6:9: **Pray**. "Prayer will make a man cease from sin, or sin will entice a man to cease from prayer" (John Bunyan)

6:9: **Pray**. Someone has said that many Christians offer their prayers like sailors use their pumps: only when the ship leaks. But look how Jesus went through His earhly ministry: He habitually rose early in the morning to commune with His Father, and in the evenings He would frequently go to some quiet place to pray. (MacArthur)

6:9: **Pray**. "Man is at his greatest and highest when upon his knees he comes face to face to God" (Martyn Lloyd-Jones; quoted by MacArthur)

6:9: **Prayer** and fasting. Fasting is meaningless apart from prayer, because apart from prayer it is apart from God. (MacArthur)

6:9: (<u>the approach to prayer</u>) **Prayer** is an opportunity for God to manifest His goodness and glory. It's done for God's sake, to glorify Him. **Prayer** centers on God's glory, not on man's needs. It is not for claiming God's promises, or making demands, but it is to acknowledge His sovereignty, to see the display of His glory and to obey His will.
(MacArthur)

6:9: **Pray like this**. It is clear that Jesus did not give this prayer for it to be repeated. 
1) The disciples asked Him *how* to pray, not to teach a prayer (Lk 11:1);
2) **Like this** carries the idea of "in the following manner" or "along these lines";
3) Jesus has just warned the disciples not to pray with "meaningless repetition" (v. 7). He could not contradict Himself by immediately giving a prayer to be recited verbatim;
4) Nowhere in the NT do we find an instance of any prayer used in a repetitious, ritualistic manner.

6:9: **Pray like this**. It is not a substitute for our own prayers, but a guide for them. (MacArthur)

6:9-13: (<u>Structure</u>). Two sections, three petitions each. 
The first section deals with God's glory: petitions in behalf of God's name, His kingdom, and His will.
The second section deals with man's needs: petitions for daily bread, forgiveness, and protection from temptation.
(MacArthur)

6:9-13: From the perspective of the attitude and spirit of prayer: **Our** reflects unselfishness; **Father** family devotion; **hallowed be Thy name** reverence; **Thy kingdom come** loyalty; **Thy will be done** submission; **give us this day our daily bread** dependence; **forgive us our debts** penitence; **do not lead us into temptation** humility; **Thine is the kingdom** triumph; **and the glory** exultation; **forever** hope. (MacArthur)

6:9-13: (<u>Structure</u>) Every element centers on God, acknowledging His: paternity, priority, program, plan, provision, pardon, protection, preeminence. (MacArthur)




















##### The Lord's Prayer: Petitions for God's glory

6:9: (<u>God' Paternity</u>) **Our Father**. God is the Father in heaven of those who trust in Him.
Pagans invariably had fear for their deities; to be able to go to God as our heavenly Father means the end of fear. It also gives hope: if our earthly father spares no effort to help and protect his children, how much more will the heavenly Father love, protect, and help His children? We also know that our heavenly Father will never leave us or forsake us. And **Our Father** indicates God's eagerness to hear our prayers, and to use His power to the petitions of His children.
God's fatherhood also should mean our obedience. "Whoever does the will of My Father... is My brother and sister" (Mt 12:50).
(MacArthur)

6:9: (<u>God' Priority</u>) **Hallowed** (Gk. hagiazo) means "to make holy". To hallow God's name is to revere, honor, glorify, and obey Him as singularly perfect. We must have a constant awareness of His presence, not sporadic thinking of Him. To truly hallow His name is to consciously draw Him into every daily thought, every daily word, and every daily action. "I have set the Lord continually before me" (Ps 16:8). Then God's name is hallowed: when we behave in conformity to His will. (MacArthur)

6:9: **Hallowed be Thy name**. After calling God with a tender **Our Father**, Jesus opens up great dimensions of reverence, awe, appreciation, honor, and adoration. This phrase protects against any sentimentalism, overuse and abuse of **Father**, which is prone to being sentimentalized. 
**Name** represents all that He is: his qualities and His character. We know God's character, and **hallow** Him.
(MacArthur)

6:10: (<u>God' Program</u>) **Thy kingdom come**. Our greatest desire should be to see the Lord reigning in His kingdom. To pray "**thy kingdom come**" is to pray for God's program to be fulfilled. (MacArthur)

6:10: **Kingdom** (Gk. basileia) does not refer to a territory, but to sovereignty and dominion. When we pray **Thy kingdom come**, we are praying for God's rule to come, His reign on earth to begin. (MacArthur)

6:10: **Come** translates the aorist imperative of *erchomai*, indicating a sudden, instantaneous coming. It speaks of the coming millennial kingdom, not an effort to gradually bring in a more godly society. (MacArthur)

6:10: **Thy will be done on earth**. The very fact that Jesus tells us to pray these words indicates that God's will is *not* always done on earth.  God is not now ruling on earth as He rules in heaven. (MacArthur)

6:10: (<u>God' Plan</u>) **Thy will be done on earth, as it is in heaven**. It already is God's plan to do His will on earth. Even though God is sovereign and His will will be done, He still wants us to pray for it to come. Why ask for the inevitable? To exercise our own volition in this area. When we pray **thy will be done**, we are praying that God's will become our own will. \[We bring our will in sync with God's will\]
(MacArthur)

6:10: **Thy will be done**. God is sovereign, but He is not independently deterministic. In His gracious plan, prayer is essential to the proper working of His divine will on earth. In fact, lack of faithful prayer inhibits His will being done (!). God is sovereign, but He gives us choices. Remember that "the effective prayer of a righteous man can accomplish much (Jas 5:16). (MacArthur)

6:10: **Thy name, Thy kingdom, Thy will**. "Shall I pray to change Thy will, my Father, until it accord to mine? But no, Lord, no: that shall never be. Rather I pray Thee blend my human will with Thine" (Amy Carmichael). 
The great enemy of God's will is pride. For God's will to be accepted, self-will must be forsaken in the power of the Holy Spirit. When we pray in faith and in conformity with God's will, our prayer is a sanctifying grace that changes our lives dramatically. Prayer is a means of progressive sanctification.
(MacArthur)

6:10: **Thy will be done**. To be dedicated to God's will is to be opposed to satan's. The starting point is to rebel against the worldly idea that sin is normal, inevitable, and should be tolerated. 
To pray for God's will is also to rebel against the idea that wicked things are somehow done in accordance to God's holy will. Nothing wicked or sinful comes from God. It is God's will that allowed sin to run its course, and satan have his way, for a season. But there is an appointed time for it to end.
To pray for God's will to be done is to pray for satan's will to be undone.
(MacArthur)

6:10: **Thy will be done**. To pray rightly is to pray in faith, believing that God will hear and answer our prayers. I think the greatest hindrance to prayer is not lack of technique or knowledge or even enthusiasm, but lack of faith. We simply do not pray with the expectation that our prayers will make a difference in our lives, in other people's lives, in the world. (MacArthur)




















##### The Lord's Prayer: Petitions for man's needs

6:11: **Daily bread** represents all of our physical needs. 
John Stott has observed that to Martin Luther: "everything necessary for the preservation of this life is bread, including food, a healthy body, good weather, house, home, wife, children, good government, and peace".
(MacArthur)

6:11: **Daily bread**. In the western society we are well-fed, and many of us even need to consume less food than we do, but in the NT times this may have been a genuine concern. (MacArthur)

6:11: (<u>God' Provision</u>) **Give us**. This statement is a petition, but also an affirmation that every good thing we have comes from God. Even though God may have already provided, we ask -- in recognition of His past and present provision, as well as in trust for His future provision. (MacArthur)

6:11: **Give us**. It is marvellous to understand that the God who created the entire universe should be concerned that we receive enough food to eat, clothes to wear, and a place to rest. God obligates Himself to supply our needs. And we only ask for what He has already promised. (MacArthur)

6:11: **us**. The **us** are those who belong to Him. God does not *bind* Himself to meet the physical needs of everyone, but only of those who trust in Him (see Ps. 37:4: "trust in the Lord .. and he will give"; 2 Cor 9:10: "will multiply your seed for sowing and increase the harvest of your righteousness"; Lk 18:30: "shall receive many times as much at this time"; Mt 6:33: "all these things shall be added to you").

6:11: **Give**. God has sometimes provided for His children through miraculous means, but His primary way of provision is through work, for which He has given life, energy, resources, and opportunity. (MacArthur)

6:11: **daily**. The schedule of God's provision for His children is **daily**. The supply is daily, and we are to rely on the Lord one day at a time. To accept the Lord's provision for the present day, without concern for our needs or welfare tomorrow, is a testimony of our contentment in His goodness and faithfulness. (MacArthur)

6:12: (<u>greek words for "sin"</u>) **Debts** (Gk. *opheilema*) is one of the five NT Greek terms for sin:
* *Hamartia* is the most common, carries the root idea of missing the mark. Sin misses the mark of God's standard of righteousness;
* *Paraptoma*, often rendered "trespass", is the sin of slipping or falling, and results more from carelessness than from intentional disobedience;
* *Parabasis* refers to stepping across the line, going beyond the limits prescribed by God, and is often translated "transgression". This sin is more conscious and intentional;
* *Anomia* means lawlessness, and is a still more intentional and flagrant sin. It is direct and open rebellion against God and His ways.
* *Opheilema* refers to moral and spiritual debts. Sin is a debt to God that must be paid.
Luke uses *Hamartia*, but Matthew used *Opheilema* probably because it corresponded to the most common Aramaic term (*hoba*) for sin, which also represented moral or spiritual debt to God.
(MacArthur)

6:12: (<u>what is sin</u>) **Sin**. Sin is that which separates man from God, and is therefore man's greatest enemy and greatest problem. Sin dominates the mind and heart of man. The ultimate effects of sin are death and damnation, and the present effects are misery, dissatisfaction, and guilt. It is a spiritual disease for which man has no cure (Jer 13:23: "can the Ethiopian change his skin or the leopard his spots?"). The natural man does not want his sin cured, because he loves darkness rather than light (Jn 3:19).
(MacArthur)

6:12: **Debt**. What debt? "As creatures we owe a debt of obedience unto our maker and governor, and through failure to render the same .. we have incurred a debt of punishment; and it is for this that we implore a divine pardon" (Arthur Pink; quoted by MacArthur)

6:12: (<u>God' Pardon</u>) **Forgive us**. Believers have received God's judicial forgiveness then moment Christ was trusted as Savior. No one, human or satanic, can condemn or bring any "charge against God's elect" (Rom 8:33-34). But because we still fall into sin (1 Jn 1:8: "if we say that we have no sin"), we frequently require God's forgiveness: His forgiveness not now as a Judge, but as Father (see note on Jn 13:5: Jesus washes the disciples' feet, where dirt symbolizes daily contamination; 1 Jn 1:9: God will "cleanse us from all unrighteousness").
(MacArthur)

6:12: (<u>confession</u>) **Forgive us**. Asking forgiveness implies confession. Feet that are not presented to Christ cannot be washed by Him. Sin that is not confessed cannot be forgiven. John makes it plain: "if we confess" (1 Jn 1:9). 
"To confess" basically means "to agree with": to agree with God about them that they are wicked, evil, defiling, and have no part in those who belong to Him.
It is difficult to confess sins, and both satan and our prideful nature fight against it. But it is the only way to the free and joyful life. "Whoever conceals his transgressions will not prosper, but he who confesses and forsakes them will obtain mercy." (Prov 28:13).
John Stott says, "One of the surest antidotes to the process of moral hardening is the disciplined practice of uncovering our sins of thought and outlook, as well as of word and of deed, and the repentant forsaking of them".
The true Christian does not see God's promise of forgiveness as a license to sin, a way to abuse His love and presume on His grace. Rather, he sees God's gracious forgiveness as the means of spiritual growth and sanctification and continually gives thanks to God for His great love and willingness to forgive and forgive and forgive.
(MacArthur)

6:12: **as we also have forgiven our debtors**. It is the prerequisite for receiving forgiveness. If we have forgiven, we will be forgiven; if we have not forgiven, we will not be forgiven (reinforced in vv. 14-15). 
We are to forgive because it is the character of righteousness, of the faithful Christian life. They will forgive. Be merciful (Mt 5:7). They love even their enemies -- because they have the nature of the loving heavenly father within them (mt 5:44-45,48). 
Forgiveness is the mark of a truly regenerate heart. It reflects God's own gracious forgiveness, and therefore expresses the highest virtue of man.
(MacArthur)

6:13: **Temptation** (Gk. *peirasmos*) in Greek means *testing* or *proving* and does not necessarily have good or evil connotations. God's holiness and goodness will never lead anyone into a place or experience in which they would purposely be induced to commit sin (Jas 1:13: "God .. tempts no one"; using *peirasmos*). 
Chrysostom explains that Jesus is here not speaking of logic, but of a heart desire to avoid the danger and trouble sin creates. It is the expression of the redeemed soul that so despises and fears sin that it wishes to avoid sin rather than having to defeat it. We know that trials are a means for our spiritual growth (Jas 1:2-3: "count it all joy"), but we have no desire to be in a place where even the possibility of sin is increased.
(MacArthur)

6:13: (<u>God' Protection</u>) **Lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil**. We know that what men and satan mean for evil, God will turn to the good of His children (Gen 50:20); but we are not certain that we will be completely submissive to and dependent on God in out trials. This petition asks God not to lead us into a trial that will present such a temptation that we will not be able to resist (1 Cor 10:13: God will not allow you to be tempted beyond what you are able"). (MacArthur)

6:13: **For Thine is the kingdom**. Although these words are not found in the most reliable manuscripts, the words are perfectly scriptural. (MacArthur)

6:14: **If you forgive**. Jesus gives a comment to only one of the petitions, thus amplifying its importance. (MacArthur)

6:14: **If you forgive men .. Father will also forgive you**. Believers cannot know the forgiveness and fellowship and blessings of God apart from forgiving others in heart and word. (MacArthur)

6:14; **Forgive** (Gk. *aphiemi*) means literally "to send away", "to leave alone", "to permit" (Strong's Concordance), "to release" (HELPS). 

6:14: **If you do not forgive .. Father will not forgive your transgressions**. An unforgiving spirit is inconsistent with God's forgiveness, and also brings the chastening of God rather than His mercy.
To receive pardon from the perfectly holy God and then to refuse to pardon others is the epitome of abuse of mercy. The sin of an unforgiving heart and a bitter spirit forfeits blessing and invites judgment. (MacArthur)




















#### Fasting

6:xx: (<u>the flow of the Sermon on the Mount</u>) ...

6:16: **Fasting**. The Bible records no teaching or practice of fasting for practical reasons, such as getting revelations, heightened spiritual experience, visions, special insight, awareness, or a better bodily shape. Legitimate fasting always had a spiritual purpose and is never presented as having *any* value in and of itself. (MacArthur)

6:16: **Fasting**. The only compulsory public fast was the Day of Atonement. On that day all people were to "humble \[their\] souls" (Lv 16:29): forsook food as an act of self-denial. When Christ died on the cross, the Day of Atonement stopped existing. (MacArthur)

6:16: **Fast**. The Pharisees saw **fasting** as an opportunity to get the approval of others who saw them. This is the same attitude they had about prayer. It was all external appearances. False humility is actually pride, and worthless in the sight of God (John Strohman)

6:16: **Their fasting**. The Talmud tells us they fasted twice a week: on the second day and the fifth day. And it has become a hypocritical, self-righteous demonstration to show how super-spiritual you are.
And if you asked a Pharisee, why? they will say because it was the second day and the fifth day which Moses went up and down from Sinai, and we commemorate that. 
But, as spiritual as it sounds, if you look a little closer in Jewish history, in the city of Jerusalem, you will find out that market day was the second and the fifth day. And those were the two days in the week when everybody from the countryside came to town. And if you were going to parade your piosity that was the time.
(MacArthur)

6:16: (<u>what causes us to fast</u>) **Fasting**. The Bible never commands a fast. To pray, yes; but never to fast. Fasting then, was a personal, non-compulsory, spontaneous, voluntary act. Even Paul never commanded a word about it. 
The Bible never commands it -- almost as if it will happen when it should happen. Because fasting is a corollary to something else: to some deep spiritual anxiety.
In Mt 9:15, Jesus said that his disciples could not fast, because it was not the time to mourn and fast. And there was no reason to do so.
In other words, when fasting is apart from some mourning as a source inducing it, is meaningless. It's corollary to something else, not an end in itself.
People would say, “Oh I fasted and I had such spiritual sensitivities. I fasted and I rose to such spiritual heights.” No, no. Fasting is a response, not an inducement to something.
When a person is deeply concerned, when their heart is exercised, when their spirit is grieved. when there’s a tremendous sensitivity and awareness of God in a spiritual struggle, the body will accommodate the heart. And there will be no thought of food. 
If fasting has a place, then what is it that causes us to fast? What brings that response?
1. *Lamentations*. Sorrow. David, when his enemies became ill, fasted (Ps 35:13). And David, when Abner died, fasted (2 Samuel 3:35). It's amazing how some people would fast out of lamentation over personal, or someone else's, calamity. Even an enemy's.
2. *Protection*. There were times when people were in such severe danger that their fear forced them to fast. They were so afraid they couldn’t eat. And they knew that their only protection and deliverance was God. And so, they would fast and they would literally cry out to God. See [Ezra.htm](Ezra 8:21) for a beautiful illustration.
3. *Humiliation* when confessing sins. When we're deeply troubled by our sin, we cannot eat. We cannot think of food, but that we pour our hearts to God, and plead for cleansing. When David sinned, and still held it in, it says that his life juices dried up. He was aching from head to toe. He was sick. He could not eat, he could not sleep, he could not exist. When distress is so deep, fasting isn't forced; it  flows out of a need to focus on a right relationship with God. The physical vanishes.
4. *Revelation*. Seeking God's truth. It does not mean you're going to get the Word. But it means that when you are so consumed with seeking a revelation or understanding from God that you have no thought of food until you come to know and understand. When’s the last time you were so intense in Bible study that you never let food interrupt it?
(MacArthur)

6:16: (<u>with prayer</u>) **Fast**. Fasting is consecration to God. And here's the key to everything: fasting is always linked with prayer. You cannot fast without praying.
I’ve searched the Scripture from one end to the other. I find no times where fasting is without praying. Fasting is not an end in itself, but is a corollary to a spiritual struggle that draws us into the presence of God. The man who prays with fasting, you see, is giving heaven notice that he’s really in earnest. That he will not give up, that he won’t let go until God blesses. 
(MacArthur)

6:16: **Disfigure their faces**. They would wear old clothes, sometimes purposely torn and soiled, dishevel their hair, cover themselves with dirt and ashes, and even use makeup in order to look pale and sickly. (MacArthur)

6:17: **Anoint your head**. Jews used to anoint themselves with fragrant oil: to protect from the sun, and to be a little more fragrant without deodorants invented. They would prepare themselves and get dressed. And this is what God expects and anticipates: we should take care of ourselves. You’re not more spiritual when you look bad. Comb your hair, wash your face, put on a little make up. Look like you always look! Just be normal.
You see, the Lord is after an inward thing, because He *sees in secret* (v. 18).
(MacArthur)

6:18: **Not be seen**. Don't try to impress anyone with your fasting: then you've crossed the line. You've done it for men.
I’ve had people even go that far in spite of what Scripture says and say, “I’m – I’m fasting". Well, you have your reward. You just got it. I know you’re fasting. You’re paid in full. God owes you nothing.
You can tell people that you have fasted; just don't parade that. And God will see the fast and He’s the only that really matters. God blesses that kind of heart.
(MacArthur)

6:18: **But by your Father**. Fasting is not to be a display for anyone, including God. Genuine fasting is simply a part of concentrated, intense prayer and concern for the Lord, His will, and His work. Jesus' point is that the **Father** never fails to notice fasting that is heart-felt and genuine, and that He never fails to reward it. (MacArthur)




















#### Lay Up Treasures in Heaven

6:19-24: (<u>the flow of the Sermon on the Mount</u>) "The Pharisees .. were lovers of money" (Lk 16:14), and Jesus first shows how their view of nonessential material things was perverted (vv. 4-24), and then how their view of essential material things was also perverted (vv. 25-34). (MacArthur)

6:19,25: **Do not lay up .. ; Do not be anxious**. Jesus considers two way in which money may become an issue. The first, when there is greed, and a person starts to *lay up treasures for himself**. The second, when there is **anxiety** and the fear of lack.

6:19: **Do not lay up**. Our view should be that material things and daily provisions are not to be looked upon with either greed or fear of lack. They are both under the sovereign hand of God, who will provide for us. (John Strohman)

6:19: **Treasures**: luxuries, material items over and above the necessities needed for life. Luxuries are not evil, but it is our attitude towards them that can be evil. (John Strohman)

6:19: Do not **lay up** (Gk. *thēsaurizete*) **treasures** (Gk. *thēsaurous*). Both words come from the same word: treasure (English "thesaurus" is a treasury of words). The repetition emphasizes the point: the idea is that of stockpiling or hoarding, and therefore pictures wealth that is not being used. (MacArthur)

6:19: **Do not lay up**. To be clear, Jesus is not advocating poverty as a means to spirituality. The Lord "richly supplies us with all things to enjoy" (1 Tim 6:17). Abraham was wealthy, and Job was made wealthier still. The riches themselves are not wrong; it is our attitude towards them that may be wrong. It is a matter of the heart (v. 21) (MacArthur)

6:19: **Moth**. In ancient times, garments represented a considerable investment. Best clothes were made of wool, and even the richest persons had difficulty protecting their clothes from the insects. (MacArthur)

6:19: **Rust** (Gk. *brosis*) literally means "an eating" and is likely to mean "the decay of the stored-up grain". (MacArthur)

6:19: **For yourselves**. This is the key to the warning: the wealth is accumulated selfishly and extravagantly. Those possessions become idols. (MacArthur)

6:20: **Lay up treasures in heaven**. You have to begin with this: *God doesn’t need your money*. God got along throughout all eternity, before He ever made you, without your money?
You see, giving is all about getting. Giving is all about being blessed. God says, release it, that I may multiply it to your account (Prov 11:25: "he that waters shall be watered himself"; Dt 16:19: "Every man shall give as he is able, according to the blessing of the LORD your God that he has given you.").
And as you give, God blesses. God blesses you out of your giving. And out of that blessing, you give again. That's the cycle of blessing. And if you don't give, you step out of it. If you don't sow, there's nothing to be blessed for (2 Cor 9:6: "if you sow sparingly, you reap sparingly").
As you scatter resources, do you realize a farmer takes everything he has and throws it in the dirt and operates on faith that God will give him a return? Giving is investing with God, and trusting that He will give you a return (Lk 6:38: "give, and it shall be given unto you").
Giving is investing with God, and it is to be sacrificial. If not, it's not giving. David said, “I will not give God that which costs me nothing.”. It's not an act of love when you give something you don't need anyway. It's when you give what you yourself need that you've made a sacrifice. 
Giving is not a matter of how much you have: it's personally determined (2 Cor 9:7: "as every man purposes in his heart, so let him give") and is a matter of where your heart is and what your commitment is. 
Giving demonstrates love, not law. You're not under obligation. It is an act of love in response to need, and that’s why it’s to be cheerful, not grudging and not of necessity.
How much do you want to invest with God? How much are you willing to sacrifice for Him who sacrificed all for you? How much of the spiritual riches do you really want to be worthy of? How much of the need do you want to meet? 
So the point is, God is not saying "give" because I need your money. He’s saying "give", because it’s a spiritual exercise that brings into your life the true blessing of God.
(MacArthur)

6:21: **Where your treasure is, your heart will be also**. A person's most cherished possessions and his deepest motives are inseparable. They will either both be earthly, or both be heavenly. It is impossible to have one on earth and the other in heaven. (Jas 4:4: "friendship with the world is enmity with God"). (MacArthur)

6:21: (<u>References</u>) **Your heart**. Col 3:5-6 defines greed as idolatry. 1 Tim 6:9-10 say that it is the *love* of money that is the root of all sorts of evil. Php 4:11-14: Paul learned to be content. 1 Tim 6:5-8: being content with what you have is the right attitude. 1 Tim 6:16-19: those who are rich should be generous.

6:21: **Your heart**. Our **heart** will follow only that which it identifies as **treasure**. What is precious to you, that you will pursue.

6:21: **Your treasure**. "Too many people spend money they haven't earned, to buy things they don't want, to impress people they don't like."

6:22: **Eye is clear**. **Clear** (Gk. *haplous*, "clear", "single", "liberal", "generous"). An **eye** that is **clear** represents a heart that has single-minded devotion. (MacArthur)

6:22: **Your eye is clear**. A **clear** (Gk. *haplous*, "clear" or "single") eye was literally a healthy eye, but figuratively also an eye that looked on others generously (Sirach 32:8). An "evil eye," conversely, was a stingy, jealous or greedy eye; yet it also signifies here a bad eye. 
Therefore, the meaning of the verse is: if we value material possessions ("bad eye"), it will blind us to the truth of our disobedience and affect our whole relationship with God. 
In Greek, Jesus uses the word "single", in the sense of it being "perfect", which acts as a transition to his next point, for the "single" eye is literally undivided: thus one is not divided between two masters, as the text goes on to explain (v. 24).
(IVP)

6:22: **Body will be full of light**. The eye is the only channel of light we have, and our only means of vision. If the eye is bad (diseased or damaged), no light can enter, and **the whole body will be full of darkness**. This happens when our hearts (represented by the **eye** here) are encumbered with material concerns, they become "blind" and insensitive to spiritual concerns. 
A dirty window would prevent light from entering. 
(MacArthur)

6:23: **Eye is bad**. The Hebrew expression "evil eye" means "grudging" or "stingy". It is the heart that is selfishly indulgent. (MacArthur)

6:23: **The light in you is darkness**. The person who has an "evil eye", who is materialistic and greedy, is spiritually blind. He thinks he has light when he does not. What is thought to be **light** is therefore really **darkness**, and because of self-deception, **how great is the darkness!**. (MacArthur)

6:24: **No one can serve two masters**. One can work for two employers, but if a situation comes that their wills are opposed, a choice has to be made in favor of one of them. But here Jesus speaks of a servant, or a slave: they can not possibly have two masters; their allegiance is to one and only.

6:24: **You cannot serve God and mammon**. If a person's first motivation is acquiring financial possessions, he will inevitably face the necessity of compromising God's way.

6:24: **You cannot serve God and mammon**. The orders of those two **masters** are diametrically opposed and cannot coexist. The one commands us to walk by faith, the other demands we walk by sight. The one calls us to be humble, the other to be proud. The one to set our minds on things above, and the other to set them on things below. One calls us to love light, the other to love darkness. The one tells us to look toward things unseen and eternal, and the other to look at things seen and temporal.

6:24: **You cannot serve God and mammon**. "Where riches hold the dominion of the heart, God has lost His authority" (John Calvin; quoted by MacArthur)




















#### Do Not Be Anxious

6:xx: (<u>the flow of the Sermon on the Mount</u>) ...

6:25: A threefold **do not be anxious**. We do not realize that worry is a manifestation of self-reliance. When we fret, we are not trusting in our Heavenly Father (John Strohman)




















### Chapter 7

7:xx: (<u>the flow of the Sermon on the Mount</u>) ...

7:1: We are not to **judge**? Some think we are never to judge anything as being right or wrong. Could Jesus really say that? Just look a little further (vv.15-20) and see that Jesus instructs us to judge the *fruit* in order to be able to identify false prophets. Also see Jn 7:24 (do not judge by appearance, but judge with righteous judgment). There is an eternal difference between self-righteous condemnation of another as compared with reproving a person with the desire of him coming into repentance (John Strohman)

7:1: The verse should not be understood by the Christian to mean he is never to discern, evaluate or criticize anyone or anything. Note that in v. 7 He tells people to discern who the *dogs* are (we are to judge who is a dog or a swine); in v. 15, to discern *false prophets by their fruit *(vv. 16, 20); i.e., by **judg**ing. We are to "judge those within the church" (1 Cor 5:12-13), and to correct a sinning brother (Mt 18:15-17; Lv 19:17).The Christian is never to judge another with the objective of exalting himself, but with a heart of love that desires the repentance of the wayward person. Finally, the correcting believer will fully examine his own frailty, which will result in compassion for the person he approaches (See Gal 6:1-3). (John Strohman)

7:1: In our country of relativism 132 and political correctness, a person who makes any type of meaningful moral judgment is considered ignorant and intolerant. The relativist's view is that the highest form of morality is to maintain that there is no such thing as morality or judgment. They love to quote this verse. In their unregenerate minds, the verse means that one has no right to make a judgment on any ungodly or perverted behavior. (John Strohman)

7:2: To analyze this section, one needs to start by putting vv.1-6 in its correct context. The passage is a continuation of the Sermon on the Mount, which is constantly demonstrating the distinction between false/hypocritical religion and a true love for God.  Pharisees (who were among the hearers) had set up a religion of their own by changing God's Word. They had no problem judging (i.e condemning) others because they judged themselves superior to others, who did not live up to their man-made religious standards.

7:6: He is saying that we are not to continue to share the beautiful truths of God with those who treat them as garbage and blaspheme them. Also: Mt 10:14 ("shake off the dust"). (John Strohman)

7:7: Note how Jesus calls our attention to verbs that represent active endeavor of searching God: **ask, knock, seek**. Although "no one can come to [Jesus] unless the Father ... draws him" (Jn 6:44), Jesus emphasizes the persistence and perseverance that has to come from the human side as well.

7:21: Jesus does not want us to be externally religious; He wants us to be in a relationship with Him: to have a heart-to-heart connection with Him. (said: Byron Johnson)

7:21: **Lord, Lord**. Mt: This verse is essentially saying that some people who think they will go to heaven would actually end up in hell.
in this verse there is a condition for entering the kingdom of God. 
These words, **Lord, Lord**, express their surprise: many people would go to hell eternally disappointed because they thought that their religiosity was enough. They depend on their morals, their good deeds, their church membership, their religious feelings, their baptism.
d. 
How does a man enter the kingdom of God? By doing *the will of the Father* who is in heaven. Lip profession is not enough, there's got to be obedience. 
(MacArthur)

7:24-27: The Lord reminds us that a standard of righteousness is required to enter the Kingdom of God. And unless your life is **built** on that standard, no matter how it looks like, when the **flood** comes, it's going to be washed away. 
Here, in both v. 24 and v. 26, you have people who **hear** the **word** or God, both have built their **houses**. They listen, and they are involved in certain spiritual activities, they both belong to the visible body of believers. They both read Scripture and both attend meetings of the church, they carry a Bible, they say certain prayers. They are both busy building some edifice of spiritual activity, and it looks very much the same. They both even built their houses in the same location, because the same storm hits both houses! But there is a tremendous difference: the foundation, that's invisible. Once the edifice is up, you can't see the foundation anymore. And so it really becomes difficult to tell. Only an honest and careful soul-searching and self-examination can reveal the truth.
(MacArthur)

7:24: **rock** (Gk. *petra*) — rock bed. A man is wise to build on such a **rock**. And this **build**ing is done by a man who **hears these words** of Jesus, and also what? **does them**. So what is the rock? The **rock** is obedience to the word of God. These sayings of Christ become the rock bed foundation of the church. 
See further note on Mt 16:18: "on this rock I will build my church". 
See also in Acts 20:32: "I commend you to the word of [God's] grace, which is able to *build you up*". It is the word of God that is our foundation, and it is the word of God that provides the material for the building as well. (MacArthur)

7:29: What is the difference? Perhaps, Jesus was explaining, and the Scribes merely commanded because "it is written"?




















### Chapter 8

8:8: Вера не только открывает человеку, какой Бог; вера также открывает человеку, каков он сам. Сотник называет себя недостойным именно по этой причине: он верит




















### Chapter 9

9:9-10: One of the worst aspects of Roman oppression was a ruthless system of **tax**ation: income tax, and property tax. Officials would buy from the government at public auction the right of collecting income taxes for a period of 5 years. Whatever was collected above that amount was kept as profit. Those who help such taxing rights were called *publicani*. **Tax collectors** (Gk. *telones*) were then hired by them, and whatever they managed to collect above the amount demanded by the *publicani* they kept as their own profit. Backed by full authority, they had strong motivation to exact and collect as much tax as possible. Quite naturally, they were hated by their own people: not only as extortioners, but as traitors: ranked with the lowest of human society — **sinners**, prostitutes and Gentiles. **Matthew,** also called Levi, was a tax gatherer. It is doubtful that he was very religious, because tax-gatherers were ostracized from many synagogues, and sometimes even from the Temple. Partly for that reason so many tax-collectors were attracted to Jesus (mt 11:19: "a friend of tax collectors and sinners"). (MacArthur)

9:9: **Tax collector**. There were two kinds.  There were Gabbai.  They were the general tax collectors; they collected property tax, income tax, poll tax, standardized.  There was not apparently as much graft at that level.  Then, there were the Mokhes.  They collected the duties.  They collected duty on everything.  They set up their little deal where the roads crossed and they collected on all import, all export, all items bought, all items sold.  They set tolls on roads, tolls on bridges, tolls on harbors.  They set tolls on axles, how many legs on your donkey, packages, letters, you name it, everything.  Everything.
That was Matthew.  He was a Mokhes, taxed everything.  There were two kinds of Mokhes.  There was one who was called a Great Mokhes.  He was a guy who hired some hireling to do the tax collecting, and he faded into the background.  He didn’t really want to be associated with the actual activity itself.  And he retained a little more dignity because he backed off.  That was called a Great Mokhes.  Then, there was the Little Mokhes, the small Mokhes.  He was too cheap to hire somebody to collect the taxes, he was so greedy he did it himself, and didn’t care about the social stigma.  And Matthew was that, a Little Mokhes.  He was, verse 9, “Sitting at the tax office himself.”  Greedy extortioner, traitor to his people.
(MacArthur)

9:9: (<u>**Matthew**, the disciple of Christ</u>) Let’s take Matthew first, because we have already examined something of Matthew’s life in looking at chapter 9.  Matthew is mentioned in every list, always in the same group, but nothing is ever said about Matthew, and nothing is ever said by Matthew except one tiny little thing.  And look in Matthew 9:9, and that’s where you find it.  Mark and Luke both allude to the same thing in just the same few words, and that is the extent of everything we know about Matthew.  “And as Jesus passed forth from there He saw a man named Matthew sitting at the tax office, and He saith unto him, ‘Follow Me.’ And he arose and followed Him.”  And when Matthew puts his name in the list in chapter 10 verse 3 he says: “Matthew the tax collector.”  And may I hasten to add that no other disciple in the list is ever associated with his job.  Why does Matthew say, Matthew the tax collector?  I mean, that’s not something you’re proud of.  No.  A tax collector was the most hated, despised, despicable human being in the society of Israel.  And Matthew is showing us his genuine humility, and sense of sinful unworthiness.
Why does Matthew even comment about himself in verse 9?  “As Jesus passed forth from there He saw a man named Matthew and He said, ‘Follow Me.’“ What is the point of putting that there?  The point is: in verses 1 to 8, Matthew is giving a demonstration that Jesus came to forgive sin.  Verse 5: “Thy sins be forgiven thee.”  Verse 6: “The Son of Man hath power on earth to forgive sins.”  And Matthew slips himself in there in one verse to show that indeed Jesus can forgive sin, for he sees himself as the vilest sinner.  It may be a reason, that may be a reason why Matthew never speaks.  He never asks a question.  He never makes a comment.  He never appears in an incident.  He just is absolutely faceless and voiceless through the entire narrative of the gospels.  And it may be that his humility was born out of his overwhelming sense of sinfulness, that he was so overwrought by the sin of his life, that once forgiven, grace was so superabundant in his case that he felt himself unworthy to even speak a word.  And so, he is the silent man, until the Spirit of God asks him to pick up his pen.  And then, he is given the privilege of writing the opening of the New Testament: 28 chapters on the majesty of the King of Kings Himself.
Matthew was a traitor.  Matthew was an extortioner.  Matthew was a robber and a thief.  Matthew was greedy.  Matthew was a social pariah, or outcast.  And he knew it.  You see, to be a tax collector is to be a publican.  And what that meant was, that you as a Jew were used by the Roman government to collect taxes from the Jews to give to Rome.  You then sort of worked for the oppressor.  You were a traitor, first class.  And not only that, but you bought the right to collect taxes, so you paid the government.  You bought into the system.  And then, the government would stipulate a certain amount of tax that had to be collected, and that was given to Rome.  And then, you were free to collect anything more you could from the people, and that you kept for yourself.  And so, there were bribes, and extortionist’s routes taken, abuses beyond what we could even dream.  They hated a tax collector so much that the Talmud said, “It is righteous to lie and deceive a tax collector.”  That is the Talmud says that, not the Bible, so keep that in mind.  No tax collector was ever permitted to testify in a court of law because everyone knew they were liars, and took bribes.  No tax collector or publican could ever enter a synagogue or a temple to worship God because they were cut off from God.  And that’s why in Luke 18 when you have the publican, it says, “And the publican standing a far off, beat on his breast and said, Lord, be merciful to me,” a what?  “A sinner.”  He couldn’t even go in the place.  They were the worst, turned their back on their people, bought into an evil oppressive system.  A pagan, uncircumcised system where the people worshipped a false god, the emperor, traitors.
I think what makes it so fascinating to me also: he also had a name Levi, which indicates that he really was in the flow of Jewish tradition.  And what also is interesting is that in the gospel of Matthew, you might be interested to note, there are more quotes of the Old Testament than in Mark, Luke and John combined.  So, Matthew knew the Old Testament.  In fact, he quotes out of the three sections of the Old Testament that a Jew knew: the law, the prophets, and the Hagiographa, the Holy Writings.  Matthew knew the law of God in the Old Testament.  And yet, we have no idea of him at all being interested in spiritual things.  But when Jesus comes along, verse 9, He says to him, “Follow Me,” and he arose and followed Him.  Instantly.
(MacArthur)

9:14: Devout Jews  used to fast twice a week (Lk 18:12: "I fast twice a week"). To them, that was emblematic of holiness. And so they ask Jesus: why don't Your disciples fast??! What Jesus told them was that there is a time for fasting, and there is a time for joy. Fasting is a unique experience that is identified with grief and sorrow and pain, isolation, loneliness, fear, those kinds of times that *would not exist when you are walking in the presence of Jesus Christ*! Fasting, in the teaching of Jesus, is for the times of great concern, great anxiety, great sorrow, and great prayer. There are times when it wouldn't be appropriate to fast because you're enjoying the fullness of the presence of God and His blessing. Fasting reserved for the times of prayer: when we're so engulfed that we have no desire to eat. // Some people think that if you just arbitrarily don't eat, there's some spiritual virtue in it. But the real issue is in the prayer area.  (MacArthur)




















### Chapter 10

10:1: (<u>unqualified disciples</u>) **Twelve**. It’s a tremendous thrill for me, and I trust for you as well, to find out that these men chosen as the personal agents of Jesus Christ, these men that we imagine so often to be stained glass saints with some kind of holy perfection that has eluded the rest of us, are nothing more than people just like we are, and that God is in the business of using all kinds of people to do very, very high level, divine, spiritual and eternal tasks.  It struck me, particularly this week, as I was thinking about the apostles, how few there were of them. Just 11 faithful men, not particularly gifted either. All of them basically unqualified for the task. And yet, these men literally turned the world upside down. It is amazing what God can do with just a very few people. 
Watch this verse: “For there is no restraint to the Lord to save by many or by,” what? “few.” (1 Sam 14:6)  Did you get that?  It doesn’t matter to God whether you have a lot or a little.  That is never the issue with Him.  He can put all of His divine power through one person as easily as He could put it through a multitude.  It doesn’t matter to the Lord. 
And here Jesus has 12 men who literally turned the world upside down. Listen, what kind of people does God use?  He uses the common kind like we are. He uses the unqualified.
I’m going to close with this illustration.  There was a concert violinist who wanted to demonstrate a very important point he felt, so he hired a great hall in a city and announced that he would play a concert on a $20,000.00 violin.  He had the place packed with violin lovers, came out, and he played exquisitely, and they applauded just gloriously.  He bowed and took their applause, threw the violin to the ground, and stomped it into bits.  The people were horrified.  And then, he walked off the stage.  The stage manager came out and said, “Ladies and Gentlemen, to put you at ease, that was a $20.00.  He will now return to play the $20,000.00,” or whatever it was, “violin.”  And you know what?  They couldn’t tell the difference, and he made his point.  It isn’t the instrument; it’s the artist, right?
Now folks, let’s face it, most of us are $20.0 .00 violins, at best, right?  At best.  But oh, what music can the Master make with us.
(MacArthur)

10:2-4: (<u>kinds of disciples</u>) What have we learned about them in terms of the kind of people the Lord uses?  Well, He uses strong, dynamic, bold leaders like Peter who take charge, initiate, strategize, confront.  He uses humble, gentle, inconspicuous souls like Andrew, quietly seek no prominence but bring people to Christ behind the scenes.  He uses zealous, passionate, ambitious, uncompromising, task-oriented, insensitive men like James who wind up being early martyrs.  He uses loving, sensitive people-oriented, believing, trusting, intimate, truth-seekers like John.  He uses skeptical, analytical, mechanical slow to believe, slow-witted, visionless, pessimistic, unsure men like Philip.  And He’ll use even a man with prejudice in his heart, who is a seeker of truth, and honest, and open, and clear-minded, and deeply surrendered like Nathanael.  And He’ll use an outcast, extortionist, tax collector, a traitor, and the most hated man in his entire society like Matthew, who knows he is a sinner and seeks forgiveness, and He’ll turn him into a meek and quiet humble man who loves the riffraff of society, and who has a great faith in Christ. (MacArthur)

10:14: In Biblical times, when leaving Gentile cities, pious Jews often **shook the dust from their feet** to show their separation from Gentile practices. 
If the disciples shook the dust of a Jewish town from their feet, it would show their separation from Jews who rejected their Messiah. The gesture was to show the people that they were making a wrong choice. The opportunity to choose Christ might not present itself again. (Wikipedia)

10:34: The **peace** He is *not* going to bring is hypocritical tolerance. (John Strohman)

10:38: **Take up his cross and follow me.** Although we may speak glibly today of "our cross" as the need to put up with Aunt Molly or a leaky roof, "taking up the cross" in Jesus' day meant being forced to bear the instrument of one's execution past a jeering mob to the site of one's imminent death as a condemned criminal (IVP)

10:38: **Take up his cross and follow me.** A reference to the custom of criminals carrying their cross before they were crucified upon it. If, therefore, the figure may be pressed, the reference here is to the bearing of trials, even though they are such as point forward to greater trials in the future. (Pulpit Commentary)




















### Chapter 11

11:12: “От дней же Иоанна Крестителя и доныне Царство Небесное силою берется, и люди стремятся овладеть им, полагаясь на свои усилия” (BTI)

11:12: The pressing multitudes that had followed John continued to follow Jesus’ ministry (Luke 5:15; 12:1). This is the key to understanding Jesus’ statement that the kingdom of God suffers violence. Pointing to the huge crowds that followed John and that were now following Him, Jesus likens them to an invading army surrounding a city to capture it. “**From the days of John the Baptist until now**,” there has been an extraordinary rush of people pressing in from all sides, eager for a blessing. The “**kingdom of heaven suffers violence**,” figuratively speaking, in that people were so thronging to hear the gospel that they resembled an army trying to besiege a city. And the “**violent take it by force**”; the people entering the kingdom were not violent literally, but their eagerness to see the coming of the Messiah was so overwhelming that it was as if they were attacking a city and beating down the doors to enter. (<u>[gotquestions.org](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.gotquestions.org/kingdom-God-suffers-violence.html&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1582399365448000)</u>)

11:12: The word translated “**the violent**” always carries a negative connotation. It therefore cannot describe a positive action, as in “eager men are forcing their way into it” (J.B. Phillips). It must refer to those who opposed the kingdom. This becomes even more obvious when we recognize that the word translated “**take**” (or “lay hold of”) almost always involves malicious intent. Therefore the wicked people that fit this description are Herod Antipas, who imprisoned John the Baptist (v. 2), and the Jewish leaders who opposed Jesus’ ministry, and the kingdom to be under attack by the forces of darkness, represented by those **violent people**. (David Briones)




















### Chapter 12

12:1: Dt 23:25 permits people to **eat grain** on any **field**, and that was not counted as theft. The violation of Sabbath was in *rubbing *them with their hands: see parallel in Lk 6:1.

12:3: What is the parallel between these two episodes? Human need takes priority over ceremonial regulations, and care about people, is above religious traditions.

12:14: Notice that **Abram** agrees with his **wife Sarah** even before entering Egypt, so he was fearing a situation he did not yet encounter. It is possible that he did not foresee how bad the lie will turn out in the end: initially he thought that it was a good idea, and it all seemed to work out just fine — right until that moment when Pharaoh has decided to take Sarah as his wife. Abram probably did not have the courage to tell the truth because he’s already said otherwise.

12:14: See note on another account of Gen 20:2, where Abimelech takes Sarah as his wife.

12:31: **Blasphemy against the Spirit** is the point of no return: when the Holy Spirit had been prompting a person to stop sinning, but the person, by ignoring the spirit, has brought himself to such a condition that he is so deaf to the Spirit that he can no longer repent. For as long as you are worried about sin, you hear the Spirit's guidance, and you can repent. But if one keeps sinning, there is a point of no return, after which repentance is no longer possible: not because God won't forgive, but because the person wouldn't seek God's forgiveness. When, like the Pharisees here, the person would even deny the things that are obvious.

12:40: **Три ночи**. Три дня по еврейскому счёту получается (включая два крайних дня). А где же три ночи?
Потому что тьма была "с часа шестого до часа девятого", (то есть, в самом разгар дня с 12:00 до 15:00). Получается, что Господь специально создал ночь, чтобы она считалась как третья.
(Андроник Пантак)

12:50: **Кто будет исполнять, тот Мой брат**. Мы говорим, что мы ученики Иисуса Христа потому что мы ходим в церковь, молимся, читаем Библию. Но Ученик Иисуса Христа — это тот, кто живёт как его учитель, кто поступает, как его учитель. В таком ученике будет видно самого Христа; как он сказал, "кто видел меня, видел отца". Не то же ли правда и для нас? Кто видел христиан, видел Христа. Иначе какие же это христиане? (МЦЦ)




















### Chapter 13

13:20-21: So it is possible to **receive** the word, even to have **joy** about it, and show all the signs of being on the right path … and yet prove to be the one who **falls away**.

13:23: The seed is the same in every case, so the emphasis is on the different kinds of **soil**, which represents a human heart which can be receptive to the **word**.

13:44: **Treasure**. The parable of the man finding great treasure means that this person had been accumulating wealth all his life, and now when he has found salvation, the way to salvation which is so valuable, he is willing to give up everything that he once considered valuable for this treasure to be his. That is in exchange.

13:45: **Pearls**. The merchant looking for fine pearls also finds one whose value far exceeds the value of the pearls that he already has. The assumption is that he has been accumulating pearls his whole life, and he thought them to be valuable, and no he willingly gives them up because he recognizes that the true value is nothing compared to the value of this particular one.

13:46: Notice that the **merchant** had to sell **all** that he had, and was willing to do so. This represents letting go of the things we used to value in order to get something that is far better.

13:47-48: This is how the modern day church works: like a **net**, it gathers **fish of every kind**: both believers and unbelievers; but when it is **full**, when the endtime comes, it will be **sorted**. Apostle Paul expresses the same idea in 1 Cor 11:19: even within the church there are factions, and it “has to be” so, for when people divide, those who are genuine tend to stick together, and are thus clearly seen.




















### Chapter 14

14:6: Now when somebody comes along and says, Well, how come you Christians say you’re the only ones that have the truth?” You tell them that’s what Jesus said. Jesus, without question, is the most narrow-minded human who ever lived. He said, “Everything I say to you is true and anything else is false.” Only He back up the fact that He had a right to say it. Amen?
You see, this is what he’s saying here. You don’t make it, people, you don’t make it. You come miserably, woefully short of the standard for my kingdom. I’m a king. Matthew is saying that all the way through and I’m offering a kingdom, but you’re not going to get in it on the terms that you are now offering. There’s another way. And that is to realize that you can’t make it. Your theology is inadequate. Your religion is inadequate and your approach to life is inadequate. You need somebody to wash away your sin, purify you, give you a new nature fit for my kingdom. And I’m that somebody is what Christ is saying.
(MacArthur)

14:23: When someone is going **up on the mountain to pray**, walking uphill is part of this experience. It takes times to get up there, and you have time to prepare mentally, to think what are you going to pray about. It must be an experience that makes your head very clear: while the legs are moving, circulation improves. As a result, when you’ve reached your destination, you’re not only alone on the hill, but you are also prepared to pray — unlike those spontaneous prayers that we do from day to day when we have time and have just quit doing our business.

14:30: **Began to sink**. People always say, “oh, Peter, you have no faith, you sunk”. You think Peter had no faith because he sunk; but look, there’s 11 guys who never even got out of the boat!
So, before you get on Peter’s case, realize where he was. People say, well, Peter denied the Lord.  Right, but he was in the place where he was confronted with that because he had enough courage to follow all the way to the house of the high priest. The other guys had split. I mean, he was always in the middle of the action.  He was always where it was going on.  And when the resurrection came, who was the first one there? Peter and John. (MacArthur)




















### Chapter 15

15:19:  sin pervades us, all of our inmost being.  Sinfulness is at the very core of the human soul.  Jesus said, for example in Matthew 15:19 and 20, “Out of the heart come evil thoughts, murders, adulteries, fornications, thefts, false witness, slanders.  These are the things which defile the man.”  And then he said, “The evil man out of the evil treasure of his heart brings forth what is evil, for his mouth speaks from that which fills his heart,” Luke 6:45.  In other words, down deep in the human heart is pervasive sinfulness, and it rises to create the kind of words and the kind of actions that we label as sinful.  Frankly, it is human nature to love sin and hate God.  The carnal mind, Romans 8:7 says, is enmity against God.  We are born loving sin, loving ourselves, hating righteousness, and hating God.  Yet, though we are born that way, mark this, sin is not a weakness or a flaw for which we cannot be held responsible.  It is an energetic, purposeful antagonism toward God that rises out of our will.  Sinners freely, willfully and gladly choose sin.  In other words, the sin that is in us manifests itself in a deliberate, willful rebellion against God. (MacArthur)

15:19: eventually, those things on the inside will show up on the outside.  No one ever falls into adultery.  We read about that with pastors and others.  No one ever falls into adultery.  The adulterer’s heart has been shaped by a long process of sinful thoughts and lustful thoughts.  It gets shaped that way.  The heart of the thief, it is bent long before his act of thievery by covetousness.  All sin is first incubated in the mind.  And James says in James 1:13, “Let no one say when he is tempted.  I’m being tempted by God for God cannot be tempted by evil and He doesn’t tempt anyone, but each one is tempted when he is carried away and enticed by his own lust.  When lust is conceived it gives birth to sin, and when sin is accomplished it brings forth death.”  Don’t be deceived, brethren, it all starts inside. (MacArthur)




















### Chapter 16

16:6: The **Pharisees** expected their reward in heaven, while the **Sadducees** expected theirs in this life, but the trust of both groups was in personal works and self-effort. Both emphasized the superficial and nonessential, and had no concern for the genuine inner spiritual life of for the welfare of their fellow man. That was "the leaven of the Pharisees and Sadducees," the hypocritical, self-serving, dead externalism about which Jesus warned His disciples (Mt 16:6). (MacArthur)

16:16: Those words are not human words (v. 17: "flesh and blood has not revealed this to you"); that is a divine revelation. 

16:18: **Peter**, Gk. *Petras*, does not mean *rock bed* like in Mt 7:24 (man who built his house on a rock, Gk. *petra*); it means a boulder, a pebble. Jesus says that "you, Peter, are a pebble". A masculine word. The **rock** that comes later is *petra*, which means rock bed, and is a feminine noun. "But upon this rock bed foundation, *petras*, I will build my church". And what was the *petra*? This rock bed foundation is the word of God. "Upon that affirmation of truth I will build my church". 
I am convinced that this *petra* is the word of God, and the *petra* of Mt 7:24 is also the word of God. (MacArthur)

16:18: “**I say unto you, you’re Peter, you are a stone, but upon this bedrock,**” He used a different term there, “**Upon the rock of your confession, I will build My church and the gates of Hades shall not prevail against it**.”

16:19: **you** is singular; in a parallel passage in Mt 18:18, **you** is plural.

16:19: **loose** is the same word (Gk. *luo*) Jesus had used in Mt 5:19: “whoever relaxes one of the least of these commandments and teaches others to do the same will be called least in the kingdom of heaven”.

16:19: What are **the keys of the kingdom of heaven**? You, My friend, are going to unlock the Kingdom.  Really?  Who preached the first great apostolic sermon?  Peter, the day of Pentecost.  To whom did he preach it?  To the Jews.  Who led the first Gentile to Christ?  Peter.  Who was it?  Acts 10, Cornelius.  He unlocked the Jews.  He unlocked, as it were, the Kingdom to the Gentiles.  He was the opening of the door.  And the Lord also gave that same promise, by the way, to the rest of His apostles and extended it all through the ages to all those who, by the proclamation of the gospel, opened the door to the Kingdom.  Every time I preach the gospel, I hold that key in my hand. (MacArthur)

16:24: Somewhere along your pilgrimage as a Christian you need to learn to die for yourself regularly. It saves you from being defensive, revengeful, retaliatory, hostile, accumulating the list of of things against you. (MacArthur)

16:20-23: **Get behind me, satan**. Boy, Peter’s feeling his oats now. Man, he’s gotten revelations. When he opens his mouth he might be speaking or God might be speaking. And that’s pretty exciting. Not only that, the Lord says, you’ve got the key, you’re going to unlock it. And he is feeling like a leader.  
But in this verse, “**Peter took Him**.” Now, wait a minute, took *Him*? That’s right. “And began to rebuke Him.” Took who? The Lord, the creator of the universe. He said to Jesus, “Come with me, we’ve got to get You straightened out.”
Unbelievable, the guy was, I mean, he was feeling it, and I’m the leader.  I’ve got the keys now I’m going to start using them. You’re first. It’s always the danger in leadership, isn’t it? It doesn’t know where its limits are. 
“**And the Lord said to him, ‘Get thee behind Me, Satan.’**“ Wow, that is a very clear lesson. You do not know the plan of God, and you are thinking from the human viewpoint. “**Get behind Me, Satan”**.  His mouth had just been used for God, and now his mouth was used for Satan. And now, he was doing exactly what Satan had done in the temptation: he was trying to derail Christ from the cross, and Peter was just as available to the Devil as he was to God, and that is a great lesson to learn for a leader. 
You get yourself into a position where God can use you, and the greater the potential to be used by God, the greater the potential to be used by Satan. That’s a great lesson. 
(MacArthur)

16:25: **Gain... forfeit... exchange**. Jesus is talking about an exchange: losing something to gain something. If you want to gain your soul, it will cost you your life; if you desire to save your life, it will cost you your soul. If you hold on to the things that to you are precious and reject the things that to God are precious, it will cost you your eternal soul.
There is an exchange in salvation. There is an exchange of all that I am for all that Christ is. There is an exchange of all my religious activities, ceremonies, righteous works for the person of Jesus Christ. There's a sense in which I may have spent all my life in religious achievement, but I have to lose it all in order to gain Christ, like Paul did. 
Whatever it is that I have spent my life accumulating, even if I gain the world, it would mean nothing if I lost Christ. The wise person looks at everything in life, measures it against the value of the loss of his eternal soul and says it isn't worth it, I will give this up to gain my eternal soul.
(MacArthur)




















### Chapter 17

17:12: The difficulty here is that John explicitly says that he is not **Elijah **in Jn 1:21. John indeed is not Elijah himself, but has come “in the spirit and power of Elijah" (Lk 1:17). See: [https://christianity.stackexchange.com/questions/14020/](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://christianity.stackexchange.com/questions/14020/how-did-john-the-baptist-have-the-spirit-and-power-of-elijah?newreg%3De7331f57bde74d2eb4da877bdec06cce&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1582399365454000)




















### Chapter 18

18:17: **Как язычник и мытарь** — а это как? Отпусти его, и пусть сам разбирается. (Авксентий)

16:19: **you** is plular; in a parallel passage in Mt 16:19, **you** is singular.

18:10: **У меня много людей в этом городе**, готовых к жатве. Не тех, кто уже уверовал и поддержит Павла; а тех, кому надлежит уверовать, и пока это не состоится, всё будет спокойно.        

18:10: “**Do not be afraid**”, the Lord said: “Go on speaking, do not be silent. I am with you and no man will attack you in order to harm you - ” listen to this, “ - for I have many people in this city.”  They weren’t converted yet.  They weren’t converted yet.  You go there, you preach as I have many of the holy seed already there.  They’re just waiting to hear.

18:18:  Идет ли речь о том, что все постановления апостолов и их преемников будут подтверждаться Небом, или же о том, что от того, что соберет человек в своей душе и что он из нее изринет за дни своей земной жизни, зависит образ его вечности? (Протестантам о православии)

18:18: **Остригши голову.** Если это был обет назорея, то это значит, что в течение этого периода Павел не пил вина в вечере господней. Однако так как не сказано, какой это обет, то это не факт.




















### Chapter 19

19:24: See note on 6:4, where it explains that Jews believed giving alms saves the soul. Consequently, it was easier for the rich to get into heaven.




















### Chapter 20

20:2: The Jewish interpretation by Rashi argued that when a stranger comes to town, the proper thing to do would be to inquire if he needs food and drink, not whether his female companion is a married woman, and hence as Abimelech did the latter, it tipped off Abraham to the fact that there is no fear of God in this place, and so he lied about his relationship with Sarah in order to avoid being killed. Consequently, it could be argued that the parallel behaviour results from this lack of fear of God by the antagonists in the other two similar situations.
Christian interpretation of the incidents has varied considerably. Some commentators have seen them as regrettable exceptions in the lives of those who otherwise lived upright lives, in the same sense perhaps as Noah's and Lot's drunkenness and David's adultery. On the other hand, commentators such as Allan Turner, in his essay "Lying: Is It Ever Right?", takes the standpoint that the patriarchal individuals did not actually lie, but merely concealed part of the truth.
(Wikipedia)




















### Chapter 21

21:9: “**Hosanna!**" was something the Jews would have shouted during this feast anyway, since this is a line from the Hallel (Ps 118:25). (*Hallel* are Ps 113-118: Psalms of praise, recited by observant Jews on every Jewish holidays)

21:12: The Pharisees were extremely wealthy. Under the leadership of Annas, they ran the **Temple** franchise: the **money exchanging** and the sale of sacrificial **animals**, and charged exorbitantly for those services. It was therefore the Sadducees' business that Jesus damaged (Mt 21:12-13). (MacArthur)

21:29: первый сказал "**не хочу**": это эмоция. Второй сказал "**да государь**": с таким праведным тоном сказал, зная, какие правильные слова должны прозвучать. Но сказал он это лицемерно.




















### Chapter 22




















### Chapter 23

23:3: It is interesting that instead of saying “don't listen to the Pharisees", Jesus actually to **do and observe** whatever they say. At the same time, He rebukes their hypocrisy (v. 13).  All together, He says that there's nothing wrong about being scrupulous; just make sure that the greatest commandment is taken care of first.

23:8: Elsewhere, Paul calls himself a **father**: “For though you have countless guides in Christ, you do not have many fathers. For I became your father in Christ Jesus through the gospel.” (1 Cor 4:15). Obviously, Jesus did not forbid the use of the word “father” for men, but rather, one of its meanings. In context, Jesus spoke about the vanity of the Pharisees who loved to call themselves “fathers” and “teachers”; it is this vanity that Jesus warns about. He teaches that instead we are all **brothers**, no one is higher than another, and everything that we have we’ve gotten from the One Father in Heaven.




















### Chapter 24


24:44: **Будьте готовы**. Что значит быть готовым? Не откладывать, и сохранять себя в состоянии готовности, то есть, праведности: готовности к встрече с Господом.

24:45: **Господин**. Используется образ хозяина, который ушёл и, как кажется постояльцам, отсутствует. Однако при этом дом остаётся в его распоряжении, и он волен вернуться и установить свои порядки как только пожелает.

24:45: **Поставил над**. Здесь стоит понимать позицию руководителя в широком смысле: управляющий хозяйством. То есть, делами, ситуациями, отношениями с людьми. Кто **верный** (кому? Богу) **и благоразумный**, тот поступает праведно, и распоряжается хозяйством по Его воле; а кто злой раб, тот распоряжается ресурсами недобросовестно. Очевидно о таком человеке, что Христос ему не царь.





















### Chapter 25

25:44: The hallmark of the wicked is to do good (including showing mercy) to people only when there is something in it for themselves: be it any immediate benefit, a potential of reciprocity, or just a chance to look good in the eyes of others. The wicked share in the surprise of the righteous when they learn that the Lord was among those needy people, but their additional surprise was about missing such an opportunity: had they only known that there have been chances to do the right thing personally to the Lord (servility, fake obedience), they wouldn’t have missed it.

25:44: The vindictive, heartless, indifferent are not subjects of Christ’s kingdom. When they pass need by on the other side, as the priest and the Levite did in the story of the good Samaritan, they show they have passed Christ by.




















### Chapter 26

26:17: **Passover**. В еврейской традиции, Пасху можно было отмечать в день пасхи, днём ранее, или через месяц. Иисус решил отметить её со своими учениками на день ранее, чтобы быть закланным в сам праздник Пасхи. (Андроник Пантак)

26:26: Евангелисты не передают нам, какими именно словами Иисус благословляет хлеб. Понятно, почему они этого не делают: просто потому, что слова, завершающие пасхальную субботнюю трапезу, знал любой ребенок Израиля: «Благословен Ты, Господи Боже наш, Царь вселенной, Ты, питающий весь мир Твоею благостью, Твоею благодатью, Твоим милосердием и благоутробием Твоим. Ты даруешь всякой плоти ее пищу, ибо Твое милосердие пребывает вовек. Твоею великою благостию нам никогда не было недостатка в пище; да не будет у нас никогда недостатка в ней, ради любви к великому Имени твоему, ибо Ты хранишь и поддерживаешь все живущее, творишь добро всем и посылаешь пищу всему, что Ты создал. Благословен Ты, Господи, дающий всем нам пищу! Благодарим Тебя, Господи, за то, что Ты дал отцам нашим в наследие землю обширную, добрую и вожделенную, и за то, что Ты вывел нас, Господи, Боже наш, из земли Египетской, из дома рабства, а равно и за завет Твой, который Ты запечатлел в нашей плоти…» (Протестантам о Православии)

26:28: In Ex 24:8, "Moses took the **blood** and threw it on the people and said, "Behold the blood of the **covenant** that the Lord has made with you". Jesus uses the same words when making a new covenant with His Own blood. While fulfilling an ancient rite, our Savior has established a new rite.

26:57: Who crucified Christ? The **priests**. Those thought to be believers in God, more than that — **the high priests**, the servants of God, crucified Him when He came. “Believers” have killed their God.
What does it say about their religion?

26:60: They were unable to find two **witnesses** whose testimony were in agreement. Jewish Law required this for every criminal proceeding: Dt 19:15

26:65: It was forbidden by the Law for the **High Priest** to tear **his robes** (Lev 21:10). The whole proceeding is a farce, with many God's laws broken. This adds another detail to their hypocritical righteousness, and voids the High Priest's false concern for God's Name being **blasphem**ed.

26:73: Galileans had an accent.

26:75: **Peter** lied to save his life. Nevertheless, this was treason: he **denied** Jesus, nothing less. If it's a sin to deny knowing God to save one's life, how much more bolder shall we be in confessing Jesus when our life is not in danger?

26:75: Later **Peter** had to confess his love for Jesus the same number of times (Jn 21:15-17).




















### Chapter 27

27:51: Geological evidence for the earthquake:”We have tabulated a varved chronology from a core from Ein Gedi on the western shore of the Dead Sea between deformed sediments due to a widespread earthquake in 31 BC and deformed sediments due to an early first-century earthquake. The early first-century seismic event has been tentatively assigned a date of 31 AD with an accuracy of ±5 years.” [https://christianity.stackexchange.com/q/14153/43703](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://christianity.stackexchange.com/q/14153/43703&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1582399365459000)

27:59: **Joseph took the body**. Коснувшись мёртвого тела, Иосиф стал нечист, и потому не мог продолжать отмечать пасху. Столкнувшись с выбором между милостью к человеку и религиозной традицией, Иосиф сознательно выбирает милость. (Андроник Пантак)
