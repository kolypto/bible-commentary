## Philemon

### Introduction
Paul is in prison, and writes to Philemon, a prominent member of the church in Colosse. Philemon was wealthy enough to have a large house (v. 2: "church in your house") and owned at least one slave, Onesimus. 
Onesimus was not a believer at the time he stole some money (v. 18: "if he has wronged you, or owes you anything"). Like countless thousands of other runaway slave, Onesimus fled to Rome. There he met Paul and became a Christian.
(MacArthur)

As he grew in Christ, he spent much time and effort helping Paul, who was severely constrained by his imprisonment.
As much as Paul would like to have retained the services of Onesimus, Paul knew that Onesimus’s fugitive status, severed relationship, and wrongdoing against his master needed to be addressed. Paul thus wrote this letter as an appeal to Philemon to appreciate the transformation that has occurred in Onesimus’s life and to receive him back not merely as a bondservant but as a “beloved brother” (v. 16).
(ESV)


### Slavery
Slaves in the Roman Empire were not legally considered persons: they could be bought, sold, inherited, exchanged, or seized to pay their master's debt. By the time of the NT there was a realization that a content slave was more productive, so masters tended to treat them more leniently. It was not uncommon for a master to teach a slave his own trade, and some masters and slaves became close friends. 
In AD20 the Roman Senate granted slaves the right to a fair trial. It also became common for slaves to purchase their freedom.
Some slaves enjoyed very favorable and profitable service under their masters and were better off than many freemen because they were assured of care and provision. Many freemen struggled in poverty.
(MacArthur)

### Christianity and Slavery
The NT nowhere directly attacks slavery. Instead, Christianity undermined the evils of slavery by changing the hearts of slaves and masters. 
Paul's instruction here provides the biblical definition of forgiveness, without ever using the word.
(MacArthur)

### Greeting

1:1: **a prisoner**. This is one of the prison epistles, along with Ephesians, Philippians, and Colossians. (MacArthur)

1:1: **a prisoner**. By beginning this letter with his imprisonment and not his apostolic authority, Paul made this letter a gentle and singular appeal to a friend. (MacArthur)

1:1: **Philemon**. A wealthy member of the Colossian church which met in his house (v. 2). (MacArthur)

1:2: **Apphia, .. Archippus**. (probably) Philemon's wife and son. (ESV)

1:2: **in your house**. First-century churches men in homes. Church buildings were unknown until the 3rd century. (MacArthur)

1:2: **to .. the church in your house**. Paul wanted this personal letter read in the church. This reading would hold Philemon accountable, as well as instruct the church on the matter of forgiveness. (MacArthur)

1:3: **Grace .. and peace**. This greeting appears in all 13 of Paul's letters. It highlights salvation's means (grace) and its results (peace) and links the Father and Son, thus affirming the deity of Christ. (MacArthur)

### Philemon's Love and Faith

1:4: **remember you**. Before Paul makes his appeal, he graciously and tactfully expresses his thanksgiving for Philemon and describes how he prays for him. (ESV)

1:7: **knowledge of every good thing**. Philemon's sharing will result in his own deeper awareness and experience of the blessings that Christ has for him. (ESV)

1:7: **I have .. joy, .. from your love**. Philemon was well known for his love for his fellow believers, which brought Paul great joy. He had been actively involved in ministering to other Christians in a way that had profoundly encouraged them. (ESV)

### Paul's Plea for Onesimus

8: **bold .. to command**. Because of his apostolic authority, Paul could have ordered Philemon to accept Onesimus. (MacArthur)

9: **I rather appeal**. Paul called for a response based on the bond of love between himself and Philemon. (MacArthur)

10: **my son Onesimus, whose father I became in my imprisonment**. Paul has led Onesimus to faith somehow while being in prison in Rome. To Paul, he was a son in faith. (MacArthur)

10: **father**. Paul uses the term "father" for a person who was instrumental not only in a person's salvation, but also in their spiritual growth. See 1 Cor 4:15: " For though you have countless guides in Christ, you do not have many fathers. For I became your father in Christ Jesus through the gospel." See also Gal 4:19: "I am again in the anguish of childbirth until Christ is formed in you": Paul explains that becoming a father is not just leading to Christ, but also seeing the person grow in Christ.

11: **useless .. useful**. A play on words. Onesimus means "useful". Paul's point is that Onesimus has been radically transformed by God's grace.

12: **sending him back to you**. It probably took Onesimus courage to return to his former master after having run away.

12: **my very heart**. Paul has developed a fond affection for Onesimus. (ESV)

13: **serve me**. Onesimus was free, but helped Paul in his imprisonment.

14: **not by compulsion**. Paul does not want Philemon to do this just because Paul told him, but out of authentic love. (ESV)

15: **this perhaps is why**. Paul was suggesting that God providentially ordered the overturning of the evil of Onesimus' running away to find Paul, come to faith, and produce eventual good. (MacArthur)

15: **he was parted**. This phrase is best seen as "divine passive", where God is understood to be sovereignly behind the events.

15: **have him back forever**. As a Christian brother. You had him serve you as a slave; now he is back as a brother, ready to serve the community of believers. (MacArthur)

16: **no longer as a bondservant**. The "as" allowed more freedom for Philemon to ponder and then choose to do what was right, rather than having Paul command him directly. Clearly, however, Paul expected an entirely transformed relationship between the two. (ESV)

16: **more than a slave .. beloved brother**. Paul did not call for Onesimus' freedom, but that Philemon would receive his slave now as a fellow believer in Christ. 
Christianity never sought to abolish slavery, but rather to make the relationships within it just and kind.
(MacArthur)

16: **in the flesh .. in the Lord**. In this physical life, as they worked together, and in spiritual oneness and fellowship as they worshipped and ministered together. (MacArthur)

18: **if he has wronged you**. Suggests that Onesimus may have stolen money from Philemon when he ran away. This would have provided him the means to purchase passage to Rome and to live there for a time. (ESV)

18: **charge that to my accoung**. Roman society expected brutal punishment of fugitive slaves. Thus Paul is asking Philemon to do something quite extraordinary by forgiving Onesimus' debt. (ESV)

19: **I, Paul, write this with my own hand**. This action underlines his personal guarantee. (ESV)

19: **owing me even your own self**. Philemon was converted through Paul's ministry, so Philemon "owed" Paul something far greater, namely, his eternal life. The debt that Onesimus owed to Philemon, therefore, is insignificant by comparison. (ESV)

20: **refresh my heart**. As in v. 7, where Paul rejoiced because "the hearts of the saints have been refreshed through \[Philemon\]" (ESV)

21: **you will do**. Onesimus returned, and was accepted by Philemon. See Col 4:9: "Onesimus, our faithful and beloved brother, who is one of you". Another indirect proof that Philemon did as Paul had asked is that he had saved the letter which we are now reading. (MacArthur) 

21: **confident of .. you will do even more**. Paul may have deliberately not given specific instructions to Philemon, giving him the freedom to decide which course of action would be best. (ESV)

23: **Ephapras**. Epaphras is one of Philemon’s fellow Colossians, whom God had used to plant the church in that city (Col 1:7: "Epaphras, our beloved fellow servant", Col 4:12: "Epaphras, who is one of you"). He is now in Rome, also a prisoner. (ESV)

23: **Mark**. Listing Mark’s name here would serve to remind Philemon that Paul himself had worked through the issues of forgiveness, because the story of their once-severed relationship would have been well known to the believers in Colosse (Acts 15:39: "a sharp disagreement"; Col 4:10: "Mark the cousin of Barnabas (concerning whom you have received instructions — if he comes to you, welcome him)"). (MacArthur)

23: **Luke**. Luke is almost certainly the one who authored the Gospel. (ESV)
