class="c4">Introduction:<br>Reading Genesis 1-11 (Primeval history), readers will see that it&rsquo;s designed to refute ancient delusions: God is almighty (not limited, like their human-like gods); the sun and the moon are not gods in their own right but are created by God; this God does not need feeding by man but He supplies man with food; it is human sin, not divine annoyance that prompts the flood. (ESV)</span></p><h3 class="c7" id="h.z0olm242qkn0"><span class="c11 c0">The Creation of the World</span></h3><p class="c2"><span class="c4">1: After declaring that God is the Creator of all things (v. 1), the focus of the rest of Genesis 1 is mainly on God bringing things into existence by His word and ordering the created things, rather than on how the earth was initially created. (ESV)</span></p><p class="c2"><span>1:1: Although the Hebrew word for &ldquo;</span><span class="c0">God</span><span>&rdquo; (</span><span class="c3">Elohim</span><span class="c4">) is plural in form (possibly to express majesty), the verb &ldquo;create&rdquo; is singular, indicating that God is thought of as one being. (ESV)</span></p><p class="c2"><span>1:1: </span><span class="c0">The heavens and the Earth</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;means &ldquo;everything&rdquo;, because in Hebrew there was no word for &ldquo;universe&rdquo;. Genesis is therefore the beginning of everything that exists. (MacArthur)</span></p><p class="c2"><span>1:2: The initial description of </span><span class="c0">earth</span><span>&nbsp;being </span><span class="c0">without form and void</span><span>&nbsp;implies that it lacked order and content. The reference to </span><span class="c0">darkness</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;points to the absence of light. (ESV) </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c4">1:3: The absolute power of God is conveyed by the fact that he merely speaks and things are created(ESV)</span></p><p class="c2"><span>1:3: Everything that God brings into being is </span><span class="c0">good</span><span class="c4">. This becomes an important refrain throughout the chapter (see vv. 10, 12, 18, 21, 25, 31). (ESV)</span></p><p class="c2"><span>1:7: This little phrase, </span><span class="c0">and it was so</span><span class="c4">, is here to indicate that it was so, and remained so throughout the life of the universe. That&#39;s a was of saying something was fixed, and it goes against the idea of progressive creationism that God has started some evolutionary process. He fixed it, it was firm, it was established. (MacArthur)</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c4">1:7: If the solar system was brought about by an accidental collision, then the appearance of organic life on this planet was also an accident, and the whole evolution of Man was an accident too. If so, then all our present thoughts are mere accidents -- the accidental by-product of the movement of atoms. And this holds for the thoughts of the materialists and astronomers as well as for anyone else&rsquo;s. But if their thoughts -- i.e., of Materialism and Astronomy -- are merely accidental by-products, why should we believe them to be true? I see no reason for believing that one accident should be able to give me a correct account of all the other accidents. (C. S. Lewis)</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c4">1:7: Each particular thought is valueless if it is the result of irrational causes. Obviously, then, the whole process of human thought, what we call Reason, is equally valueless if it is the result of irrational causes. Hence every theory of the universe which makes the human mind a result of irrational causes is inadmissible, for it would be a proof that there are no such things as proofs. Which is nonsense. (C. S. Lewis)</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c4">1:9: God has made the planet in one day, fully mature, and with an appearance of age (MacArthur)</span></p><p class="c2"><span>1:10: What does it mean that </span><span class="c0">it was good</span><span class="c4">? It means that it was ready for habitation. (MacArthur)</span></p><p class="c2"><span>1:12: No evolution is remotely possible because there was no death, which only came with Adam&#39;s sin. The necessary prerequisite for having evolutionary processes is death, which makes natural selection possible. But there was no death, it doesn&#39;t even come before Gen 3. It was all </span><span class="c0">good</span><span class="c4">. (MacArthur)</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c4">1:14: How could God have created a world with light without celestial bodies to radiate it? &quot;The only difference is this, that the light was before dispersed, but now proceeds from lucid bodies; which in serving this purpose, obey the command of God.&quot; (Calvin). God attached the light that He had created to luminaries. (MacArthur)</span></p><p class="c2"><span>1:14: </span><span class="c0">Seasons. </span><span class="c4">The Hebrew word &ldquo;seasons&rdquo; doesn&rsquo;t mean winter, summer, spring, and fall; it means &ldquo;an assembling of the people&rdquo; or &ldquo;a gathering of the congregation&rdquo;. In other words, the stellar bodies were literally to be used by God to establish certain gatherings of the people. And if you study the Old Testament, you will find out that all of the festivals, and all of the feasts, and all of the holidays of Israel were identified by where the heavenly bodies were at a certain time. They were all in relation, for example, of the vernal equinox or the full moon. (MacArthur)</span></p><p class="c2"><span>1:16: By referring to them as </span><span class="c0">the greater light</span><span>&nbsp;and </span><span class="c0">lesser light</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;(v. 16), the text avoids using terms that were also proper names for pagan deities linked to the sun and the moon. (ESV)</span></p><p class="c2"><span>1:25: At the end of verse, </span><span class="c24">the creation of all these creatures gets a comment from </span><span class="c0 c24">God</span><span class="c24">: He said that it was good. God has been saying this all along, by the way (v. 4: God said the light was good; v. 10: the land and the seas were good, v. 12: the plants were good; v. 18: stellar bodies were good too; v. 21 the sea creatures and the birds in the air were good; and finally, after he made man, he said that it was </span><span class="c3 c24">very</span><span class="c24 c30">&nbsp;good). Everything God made was good. No deformities, no mutations, no inferiorities, no natural selection, no survival of the fittest, because there were no unfit animals. (MacArthur)</span></p><p class="c2"><span>1:26: The Hebrew word for </span><span class="c0">man</span><span>&nbsp;(</span><span class="c3">adam</span><span>) is the generic term for mankind and become the proper name, </span><span class="c0">Adam</span><span class="c4">. (ESV)</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c4">1:26: Previous God had used to say &ldquo;let there be&rdquo;, as if an impersonal form. But now the language changes, and He says &ldquo;let us make&rdquo;. Now, when God introduces Himself personally, as a Trinity, He uses the plural language. (MacArthur)</span></p><p class="c2"><span>1:26: &ldquo;</span><span class="c0">us</span><span>&rdquo; may refer to the heavenly court (sons of God, or angels), but a significant objection is that man is not made in the </span><span class="c0">image</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;of angels. God is speaking to Himself, since God alone does the making. This would be the first hint of the Trinity in the Bible. (ESV)</span></p><p class="c2"><span>1:27: Traditionally, the </span><span class="c0">image</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;has been seen as the capacities that set man apart from the other animals&mdash;ways in which humans resemble God, such as in the characteristics of reason, morality, language, a capacity for relationships governed by love and commitment, and creativity in all forms of art. (ESV)</span></p><p class="c2"><span>1:28: To &ldquo;</span><span class="c0">subdue</span><span class="c4">&rdquo; (Hb. kabash) elsewhere means to bring a people or a land into subjection so that it will yield service to the one subduing it (Num. 32:22, 29). Here the idea is that the man and woman are to make the earth&rsquo;s resources beneficial for themselves and for human beings in general. This command provides a foundation for wise scientific and technological development. (ESV)</span></p><p class="c2"><span>1:29-30: God gave them </span><span class="c0">plants</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span class="c0">for food</span><span class="c4">, not flesh. There was no killing for food before sin entered the world in Gen 3:21, where God makes clothes from animal skins, and until Gen 9:3, where He allows Noah to eat every moving thing.

(ESV)</span></p><p class="c2"><span>2:4: &ldquo;Yahweh&rdquo; is translated as &ldquo;</span><span class="c0">LORD</span><span>&rdquo; because of the ancient Jewish tradition of substituting in Hb. the term that means &ldquo;Lord&rdquo; [</span><span class="c3">&rsquo;Adonay</span><span>] for &ldquo;Yahweh&rdquo; when reading the biblical text. The Septuagint customarily used &ldquo;Lord&rdquo; (Gk. </span><span class="c3">Kyrios</span><span class="c4">), and in this form it was quoted many times by the NT authors who also used &ldquo;Lord&rdquo; rather than &ldquo;Yahweh&rdquo;. This established the precedent for our modern translations. (ESV)</span></p><p class="c2"><span>2:7: &ldquo;</span><span class="c0">formed</span><span>&rdquo; (Hb. yatsar) conveys the picture of a potter&rsquo;s fashioning clay into a particular shape. The close relationship between the man and the ground is reflected in the Hebrew words used to denote them, </span><span class="c3">&rsquo;adam</span><span>&nbsp;and </span><span class="c3">&rsquo;adamah</span><span class="c4">, respectively. (ESV)</span></p><p class="c2"><span>2:7: </span><span class="c0">the breath of life</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; physical, mental, and spiritual &mdash; placed into the man made in God&rsquo;s image. (ESV)</span></p><p class="c2"><span>2:7: Man is called </span><span class="c0">a living creature</span><span>&nbsp;&mdash; the same word applied to animals in 1:20,24. While human beings have much in common with other living beings, God gives humans alone a royal and priestly status and makes them alone &ldquo;in his own image&rdquo;, giving him alone </span><span class="c0">the breath of life</span><span class="c4">. (ESV)</span></p><p class="c2"><span>2:8: The name &ldquo;</span><span class="c0">Eden</span><span>,&rdquo; would have conveyed the sense of &ldquo;luxury, pleasure&rdquo;. Septuagint used the word </span><span class="c3">paradeisos</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;(from which comes the English term &ldquo;paradise&rdquo;) on the understanding that it resembled a royal park. (ESV)</span></p><p class="c2"><span>2:8: Notice that </span><span class="c0">Eden</span><span>&nbsp;is not the name of the garden, but the name of the area the garden was located in. Moreover, in v. 10 it&rsquo;s explicitly said that Eden and the garden were two different places: &ldquo;flowed out of </span><span class="c0">Eden</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;to water the garden&rdquo;. (ESV)</span></p><p class="c2"><span>2:10-14: While the </span><span class="c0">Pishon</span><span>&nbsp;and the </span><span class="c0">Gihon</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;are unknown, the nearly universal identification of Tigris Euphrates suggests a possible location for Eden at either their northern or southern extremes. (ESV)</span></p><p class="c2"><span>2:12: </span><span class="c0">Gold</span><span>&nbsp;and </span><span class="c0">onyx</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;are later associated with the making of the tabernacle and temple. (ESV)</span></p><p class="c2"><span>2:17: The fruit of this </span><span class="c0">tree</span><span>&nbsp;has been variously understood as giving (1) sexual awareness, (2) moral discrimination, (3) moral responsibility, and (4) moral experience. The last is the most likely: by their obedience or disobedience the human couple will come to know </span><span class="c0">good and evil</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;by experience. (ESV)</span></p><p class="c2"><span>2:17: &ldquo;</span><span class="c0">In the day</span><span class="c4">&rdquo; implies fixed certainty rather than absolute immediacy. (ESV)</span></p><p class="c2"><span>2:17: What kind of &ldquo;</span><span class="c0">death</span><span class="c4">&rdquo; does this threaten: physical, spiritual, or some combination? The Hebrew word can be used for any of these ideas, and the only way to find out is by reading to see what happens as the story unfolds. (ESV)</span></p><p class="c2"><span>2:18: </span><span class="c0">not good</span><span>&nbsp;is a jarring contrast to 1:31, where everything </span><span class="c3">was good</span><span>. Clearly, the situation here has not yet arrived to </span><span class="c3">very good</span><span>. It means that the woman was made on the same day with the man, before the creation became </span><span class="c3">very good</span><span class="c4">. (ESV)</span></p><p class="c2"><span>2:18: a </span><span class="c0">helper</span><span>&nbsp;is one who supplies strength in the area that is lacking in &ldquo;the helped&rdquo;. A wife is </span><span class="c0">fit for him</span><span class="c4">, which means she is not exactly like him, but complements him. (ESV)</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c4">2:21: Men have XY chromosomes; women have XX.</span></p><p class="c2"><span>2:23: &ldquo;</span><span class="c0">flesh of my flesh</span><span class="c4">&rdquo; highlights the sense of oneness and makes the point that marriage creates the closest of all human relationships. (ESV)</span></p><p class="c2"><span>2:24: The kinship between husband and </span><span class="c0">wife</span><span>&nbsp;creates obligations that override even duty to one&rsquo;s </span><span class="c0">parents</span><span class="c4">. In ancient Israel, sons did not move away when they married, but lived near their parents and inherited their father&rsquo;s land. They &ldquo;left&rdquo; their parents in the sense of putting their wife&rsquo;s welfare before that of their parents. (ESV)</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c4">2:25: The verse offers a picture of innocent delight. (ESV)</span></p><p class="c2"><span>2:25: A play on the similar sounds of the words &ldquo;</span><span class="c0">naked</span><span>&rdquo; (Hb. </span><span class="c3">&lsquo;arummim</span><span>) and &ldquo;crafty&rdquo; (3:1, Hb. </span><span class="c3">&lsquo;arum</span><span class="c4">) links the end of this episode with the start of the next.

Moreover, they are expected to exercise authority over all the beasts of the field, which includes the serpent. This is not merely an act of disobedience; it is an act of treachery. Those who were meant to govern the earth on God&rsquo;s behalf instead rebel against their divine King and obey one of his creatures. (ESV)</span></p><p class="c2"><span>3:5: </span><span class="c0">You will be like God</span><span>&nbsp;(the whole phrase in Hb. </span><span class="c3">kelohim</span><span>)&mdash; not become completely like Him, but acquire a particular quality that God had, but they hadn&rsquo;t: </span><span class="c0">knowing good and evil</span><span>. Ultimately, in their desire become </span><span class="c3">more </span><span>like God, just the opposite happened: they have become </span><span class="c3">less like God</span><span class="c4">.</span></p><p class="c2"><span>3:4-5: The serpent was right that they </span><span class="c0">would not surely die</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;immediately, for Adam has lived for 930 years; and God acknowledges in v. 22 that &ldquo;the man has become like one of us in knowing good and evil.&rdquo;. Yet the serpent speaks half-truths, promising much but delivering little. Eating the fruit transforms the couple, but not for the better. They have come to know that they were naked, came to know evil by experience, were enslaved by it, and in their guilt they have became afraid to meet God, all resulting in them being cut off from the source of life and the tree of life, they are in the realm of the dead. (ESV)</span></p><p class="c2"><span>3:4: The </span><span class="c0">death</span><span>&nbsp;they experienced first was not physical death, but spiritual </span><span class="c0">death</span><span class="c4">: a state in which a person cannot commune with God, does not accept God, does not even like Gof, is unable to choose God, and cannot and does not want to receive anything that comes from God. Adam and Eve used to live together with God, walk and talk with God, and by their very nature they used to do His will, they naturally loved God and obeyed God. But because of their transgression, they&#39;ve been alienated from God: they&#39;ve broken that relationship, and the spiritual separation manifested itself in a physical separation: being cast out. (~MacArthur)</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c4">3:5: We must not comment too severely upon her conduct. It was no mean desire which led her astray: she longed for more knowledge and greater perfection; she wished even to rise above the level of her nature; but the means she used were in violation of God&#39;s command, and so she fell. And, as usual, the tempter kept the promise to the ear. Eve knew good and evil, but only by feeling evil within herself. It was by moral degradation, and not by intellectual insight, that her ambitious wish was fulfilled. (Ellicott)</span></p><p class="c2"><span>3:6: After the serpent&rsquo;s comment, </span><span class="c0">the woman</span><span>&nbsp;started </span><span class="c0">seeing</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;the tree differently: she started thinking about it not as a taboo, but as something good and desirable, making up her mind to come and taste something that she had used to see as forbidden and unapproachable. The serpent has somehow made the woman discontent with the permitted trees, focusing her desire on this one.</span></p><p class="c2"><span>3:6: The whole time Adam, </span><span class="c0">who was with her</span><span class="c4">, was around, and didn&rsquo;t stop his wife. </span></p><p class="c2"><span>3:9: Both &ldquo;</span><span class="c0">man</span><span>&rdquo; and &ldquo;</span><span class="c0">you</span><span class="c4">&rdquo; are singular in Hebrew.

That view sees the war between the two as raging for all time, with the people of righteousness eventually gaining victory over the people of evil. But &quot;</span><span class="c0">seed</span><span class="c4">&quot; can also be singular, in that it refers to one great, final, glorious product of a woman, who will be the Lord Himself: born without male seed. In that sense, the prediction is messianic. In may be that the prophecy looks to both the collective and the individual meanings. (MacArthur)</span></p><p class="c2"><span>3:15: The verse has traditionally been understood as pointing forward to the defeat of the </span><span class="c0">serpent</span><span>&nbsp;by a future </span><span class="c0">descendant</span><span>&nbsp;of the </span><span class="c0">woman</span><span>: a &ldquo;Protoevangelium&rdquo;, the first announcement of the gospel, the good news. This interpretation requires that the </span><span class="c0">serpent</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;be viewed as more than a mere snake, something which the narrative itself implies, given the serpent&rsquo;s ability to speak and the vile things he says. This inference is legitimate and is clearly what the apostle John has in view in Rev. 12:9 (&ldquo;the great dragon was thrown down, that ancient serpent, who is called the devil and Satan, the deceiver of the whole world&rdquo;) and 20:2 (&ldquo; the dragon, that ancient serpent, who is the devil and Satan&rdquo;).(ESV)</span></p><p class="c2"><span>3:15: Some interpreters have suggested that by saying &ldquo;</span><span class="c0">he</span><span>&rdquo; and &ldquo;</span><span class="c0">his</span><span>,&rdquo; the intended meaning is that one particular </span><span class="c0">offspring</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;is in view.

These words from the Lord indicate that there will be an ongoing struggle between the woman and the man for leadership in the marriage relationship. The leadership role of the husband and the complementary relationship between husband and wife that were ordained by God before the fall have now been deeply damaged and distorted by sin.<br>The consequences: (1) Eve will have the sinful &ldquo;desire&rdquo; to oppose Adam and to assert leadership over him, reversing God&rsquo;s plan for Adam&rsquo;s leadership in marriage. But (2) Adam will also abandon his God-given, pre-fall role of leading, guarding, and caring for his wife, replacing this with his own sinful, distorted desire to &ldquo;rule&rdquo; over Eve. Thus one of the most tragic results of Adam and Eve&rsquo;s rebellion against God is an ongoing, damaging conflict between husband and wife in marriage, driven by the sinful behavior of both.<br>The Hebrew term here translated &ldquo;</span><span class="c0">desire</span><span>&rdquo; (</span><span class="c3">teshuqah</span><span class="c4">) is rarely found in the OT.

(ESV)</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c4">4:1: Eve&rsquo;s reference to the Lord&rsquo;s help when Cain is born conveys a sense of optimism. The serpent may yet be overthrown by the offspring of the woman. (ESV)</span></p><p class="c2"><span>4:4: The key to understanding the </span><span class="c0">Lord&rsquo;s regard</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;for Abel&rsquo;s gift is not in the gift itself, but the attitude of the heart that undergirds the actions and the response to them. God knows what&rsquo;s in the heart of man, doesn&rsquo;t He? And so in v. 7 God explained to Cain that his gift was rejected not because God doesn&rsquo;t like farmers, but rather, because Cain has done something wrong while offering the gift. Probably, he was insincere.</span></p><p class="c2"><span>4:4: </span><span class="c0">The firstborn of his flock</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;is a more costly offering, expressing greater devotion. (ESV)</span></p><p class="c2"><span>4:4: At no point does the Bible suggest that </span><span class="c0">offerings</span><span>&nbsp;work </span><span class="c3">automatically</span><span class="c4">, as if the worshiper&rsquo;s faith and contrition did not matter; and Cain&rsquo;s fundamentally bad heart can be seen in his resentment toward his brother and in his uncooperative answers to God in the rest of the passage.

(ESV)</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c4">4:8: God has explained to Cain that his gift was rejected because of a wrong in his heart (v. 7: &ldquo;if you do well, will you not be accepted?&rdquo;). Still, Cain saw no fault with himself, but instead grew envious of his brother. Instead of repenting himself, he envied the one who was more right with God. This twisted thinking has led to murder.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c4">4:8: Obviously, Cain did not &ldquo;rule over&rdquo; his sin (v. 7), but instead, let the sin rule over himself.</span></p><p class="c2"><span>4:13: Cain is immediately conscious of the severity of his </span><span class="c0">punishment</span><span>:</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;he is to be alienated from both the ground and God.

In spite of much scholarly speculation, the precise nature of </span><span class="c0">the mark</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;is uncertain.

As is often the case in Genesis, the limited and selective nature of the account leaves the reader with unanswered questions. Presumably, Cain married his sister&mdash;a reasonable assumption, since the whole human race descended from Adam and Eve (Gen 3:20: &ldquo;Eve &hellip; the mother </span><span class="c3">of all living</span><span>&rdquo;), and Adam with Eve had &ldquo;other sons </span><span class="c3">and daughters</span><span>&rdquo; (Gen 5:4)</span><span class="c4">.

The traditional understanding is that the numbers should be taken at face value, often assuming that something changed in the cosmology of the earth or in the physiology of humans (or in both) after the flood, resulting in a rapid decline in longevity, finally stabilizing at a &ldquo;normal&rdquo; life span in the range of 70 years or 80 years (Ps. 90:10: &ldquo; The years of our life are seventy, or even by reason of strength eighty&ldquo;). In any case, one clear implication of these genealogies is that these people actually lived (regardless of how long), and that they actually died.

The present passage, however, reveals that this God-mandated task leads to increasing wickedness on the earth as the population expands. (ESV)</span></p><p class="c2"><span>6:2: Various scholars have proposed that the &ldquo;</span><span class="c0">sons of God</span><span>&rdquo; are (1) fallen angels; or (2) tyrannical human judges or kings (in the ungodly line of Lamech, possibly demon-possessed); or (3) followers of God among the male descendants of Seth (i.e., the godly line of Seth, but who married the ungodly daughters of Cain). Though it would be difficult to determine which of these three views may be correct, it is clear that the kind of relationship described here involved some form of grievous sexual perversion, wherein the &ldquo;</span><span class="c0">sons of God</span><span>&rdquo; saw and with impunity took any &ldquo;</span><span class="c0">daughters of man</span><span>&rdquo; that they wanted. The sequence here in Gen. 6:2 (&ldquo;</span><span class="c0">saw</span><span>&nbsp;&hellip; </span><span class="c0">attractive</span><span>&nbsp;[good] &hellip; </span><span class="c0">took</span><span class="c4">&rdquo;) parallels the sequence of the fall in 3:6 (&ldquo;saw &hellip; good &hellip; took&rdquo;). In both cases, something good in God&rsquo;s creation is used in disobedience and sinful rebellion against God, with tragic consequences. (ESV)</span></p><p class="c2"><span>6:3: God announces that because of the immoral nature of people, </span><span class="c0">their days shall be 120 years</span><span class="c4">. There are two possible interpretations of this number of years: either the lives of human beings will no longer exceed 120 years, or the coming of the flood is anticipated in 120 years. (ESV)</span></p><p class="c2"><span>6:3: Some interpreters take </span><span class="c0">120 years</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;as the countdown to the Flood.</span></p><p class="c2"><span>6:4: Although in Hebrew </span><span class="c0">the Nephilim</span><span>&nbsp;means &ldquo;fallen ones,&rdquo; the earliest Greek translators rendered it gigantes, &ldquo;giants&rdquo; (This idea may have been mistakenly deduced from Num. 13:33: &ldquo;we saw the Nephilim ... and we seemed to ourselves like grasshoppers&rdquo;). One must be cautious about reading &ldquo;giants&rdquo; back into the present passage. The </span><span class="c0">Nephilim</span><span>&nbsp;were </span><span class="c0">mighty men</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;or warriors and, as such, may well have contributed to the violence that filled the earth. (ESV)</span></p><p class="c2"><span>6:6: </span><span class="c0">God</span><span>&nbsp;is </span><span class="c0">grieved</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;over his creation, which he at first saw as very good (1:31) but which is now filled with sin.

Many interpreters, therefore, argue that a huge regional flood may have been all that was necessary for God to destroy all human beings.<br>In support of the view that the flood covered all the </span><span class="c0">earth</span><span class="c4">, other interpreters point out that the text says that &ldquo;all the high mountains under the whole heaven were covered&rdquo; (7:19) and that the water was &ldquo;fifteen cubits&rdquo; above the tops of the mountains.

Whether God had commanded Noah to make an offering is not clean, but God had foreseen this episode.</span></p><p class="c2"><span>8:20: Noah&rsquo;s first recorded act on emerging from the ark is to </span><span class="c0">build an altar to the LORD</span><span>. It is an act of gratitude, but also of atonement: the Hebrew for &ldquo;</span><span class="c0">pleasing</span><span>&rdquo; (Hb. </span><span class="c3">nikhoakh</span><span>) conveys the idea of rest and tranquility. It is related to the name &ldquo;</span><span class="c0">Noah</span><span>&rdquo; (Hb. </span><span class="c3">noakh</span><span class="c4">). It also has the sense of &ldquo;soothing.&rdquo; The burnt offering soothes God&rsquo;s anger at human sin.(ESV) </span></p><p class="c2"><span>8:20: This is the point where Noah&rsquo;s name (rest) is fulfilled: God&rsquo;s anger at human sin has been </span><span class="c3">noakh</span><span class="c4">ed: soothed/rest/tranquility.</span></p><p class="c2"><span>8:20: </span><span class="c0">Noah&rsquo;s</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;practice and ceremonial functions parallel the festival of Shavuot and sheds light on his priesly functions: God&rsquo;s first priest.

In spite of the human propensity to sin, atonement through sacrifice is possible, securing a peaceful relationship between the Lord and humanity. (ESV)</span></p><p class="c2"><span>8:22: God promised that everything will be as it is for as long as </span><span class="c0">the earth remains</span><span>, He will not interfere on a grand scale. He gave this promise, and it is evident that God holds to His promise to this day: people ask why, oh, why, there is so much evil in this world, and God does nothing? Because there had been much more evil in the world (Gen 6:5: &ldquo;every intention of the thoughts of his heart was only evil continually&rdquo;), and God had &ldquo;repented that He had made man&rdquo; (Gen 6:6), and wiped the earth clean with a flood, leaving only one righteous man and his family alive. Earth has become much better, but still God sees that the human heart is so wicked by its nature that &ldquo;</span><span class="c0">the intention of man&#39;s heart is evil from his youth</span><span class="c4">&rdquo;. Even seeing this,God promised not to destroy the earth again. <br>God gave this promise when Noah, being obedient, made an offering to God. This probably explains why this promise has been given: because of the righteous people living on this earth, it will remain.<br>The very same pattern of reasoning is clear in Gen 18:26 where Abraham pleads with God for Sodom, and God promised that He will not destroy the whole city &mdash; because of the righteous people living in it.</span></p><p class="c2"><span>9:1: </span><span class="c0">God</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;says the words similar to those He had said to Adam, because Noah is a sort of second Adam, in that he (like Adam) is father of the whole human race. (ESV)</span></p><p class="c2"><span>9:2: To Adam was given the dominion; in Noah&rsquo;s time animals started to </span><span class="c0">fear</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;the human. (ESV)</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c4">9:3: The second difference is in that humans are now given permission to be carnivorous. (ESV)</span></p><p class="c2"><span>9:6: Violence by &ldquo;all flesh&rdquo; prompted God to send the flood (6:11, 13). If human nature has not improved after the flood (8:21: &ldquo;evil from his youth&rdquo;), how is violence to be prevented in the future? This legal enactment is the answer: From his fellow </span><span class="c0">man</span><span>&nbsp;I will require a reckoning for the life of </span><span class="c0">man</span><span>, i.e. will be held accountable by God, working through human representatives (&ldquo;</span><span class="c0">shall be shed</span><span class="c4">&rdquo;). (ESV)</span></p><p class="c2"><span>9:6: Here the principle of </span><span class="c3">talion</span><span class="c4">, a life for a life, is applied. Human life is to be valued so highly that it is protected by this system of punishment because God made man in his own image, and so to murder another human being is to murder what is most like God, and is thus implicitly an attack on God himself. &nbsp;(ESV)</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c4">9:7: God wants humanity to flourish and not to be destroyed by violence or another flood. This positive view of population growth stands in sharp contrast to the Babylonian flood story, which ends with the gods taking measures to inhibit mankind from filling the earth. (ESV)</span></p><p class="c2"><span>9:9: This is the first </span><span class="c0">covenant</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;explicitly named in Genesis. A covenant formally binds two parties together in a relationship, on the basis of mutual personal commitment, with consequences for keeping or breaking the commitment. (ESV)</span></p><p class="c2"><span>9:13: Different </span><span class="c0">covenants</span><span>&nbsp;have appropriate signs or symbols linked to them. Circumcision is the sign of the covenant with Abraham (ch. 17), and the Sabbath is the sign of the covenant with Israel at Mount Sinai (Ex. 31:12&ndash;17). On this occasion God&rsquo;s designated </span><span class="c0">sign</span><span>&nbsp;is the </span><span class="c0">rainbow</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;(Gen. 9:13). Its presence, when rain clouds are in the sky, will be a visible reminder of God&rsquo;s everlasting covenant (v. 16). (ESV)</span></p><p class="c2"><span>9:18: The objective of the story may have been to justify the subject status of the </span><span class="c0">Canaanites</span><span>, the descendants of </span><span class="c0">Ham</span><span>, to the Israelites, the descendants of Shem. The narrative&#39;s short five verses indicate that Canaan&#39;s Hamite paternity must have had great significance to the narrator or redactor, according to Sarna, who adds, &quot;The curse on </span><span class="c0">Canaan</span><span>, invoked in response to an act of moral depravity, is the first intimation of the theme of the corruption of the Canaanites, which is given as the justification for their being dispossessed of their land and for the transfer of that land to the descendants of Abraham.&quot;[13] (</span><span class="c1 c6"><a class="c8" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curse_of_Ham&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1582399365181000">Wikipedia</a></span><span class="c4">)</span></p><p class="c2"><span>9:18: The text emphasizes the origins of </span><span class="c0">Canaanites</span><span>&nbsp;by naming them twice.

Descending from a father like </span><span class="c0">Ham</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;casts a shadow on on the whole nation.</span></p><p class="c2"><span>9:19: By implication, there were no other humans on the </span><span class="c0">whole earth</span><span>, because all people descended from </span><span class="c0">these three</span><span class="c4">.

Instead, Ham&rsquo;s </span><span class="c0">brothers</span><span>&nbsp;make every effort to avoid seeing Noah&rsquo;s </span><span class="c0">naked</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;body. (ESV)</span></p><p class="c2"><span>9:22: The expression &quot;</span><span class="c0">look upon</span><span class="c4">&quot; at times has sexual overtones in the Bible, as in Leviticus 20:11, &quot;The man who lies with his father&#39;s wife has uncovered his father&#39;s nakedness...&quot; As a result, interpreters have proposed a variety of possibilities as to what kind of transgression has been committed by Ham, including the possibility that maternal incest is implied. (Wikipedia)</span></p><p class="c2"><span>9:22: Later we learn that </span><span class="c0">Ham</span><span>&nbsp;was also the father of Sodomites (Gen 10:19). This fact may mean that there was a lot involved beyond just observing </span><span class="c0">his father&rsquo;s nakedness</span><span class="c4">: it may have been a sexual act with a senseless drunken father, the obvious signs of which the father has discovered only when he woke up (v. 24).</span></p><p class="c2"><span>9:22: The majority of commentators, both ancient and modern, have felt that </span><span class="c0">Ham&#39;s seeing his father naked</span><span>&nbsp;was not a sufficiently serious crime to explain the punishment that follows. His brothers, however, take the episode seriously enough. <br>The Targum Onqelos (translation of Torah into the Aramaic) has Ham gossiping about his father&#39;s drunken disgrace &quot;in the street&quot; (a reading which has a basis in the original Hebrew), so that being held up to public mockery was what had angered Noah.<br>The Babylonian Talmud (c. 500 AD) argues that Ham either castrated his father, or sodomised him. The same explanations are found in three Greek translations of the Bible, which replace the word &quot;see&quot; in verse 22 with another word denoting homosexual relations. <br>(</span><span class="c1 c6"><a class="c8" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curse_of_Ham&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1582399365182000">Wikipedia</a></span><span class="c4">)</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c4">9:23: The response of Shem and Japheth is in sharp contrast to Ham&rsquo;s actions, as the brothers honor their father despite his foolish behavior.

(ESV)</span></p><p class="c2"><span>10:6: </span><span class="c0">Ham</span><span>&nbsp;is the </span><span class="c0">father</span><span>&nbsp;of Philistia, </span><span class="c0">Egypt</span><span>, Assyria, Nineveh, and other enemies of Israel. He is the father of </span><span class="c0">Sodom</span><span>, </span><span class="c0">Canaan</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;and other nations which are seen in the Bible as base and sinful.</span></p><p class="c2"><span>10:6: </span><span class="c0">Ham&rsquo;s</span><span>&nbsp;descendants receive considerably more attention than those of Japheth and Shem. Among them figure many of Israel&rsquo;s enemies, such as the </span><span class="c0">Egyptians</span><span>, Babylonians, Philistines, and various </span><span class="c0">Canaanite</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;groups. (ESV)</span></p><p class="c2"><span>10:9: </span><span class="c0">Nimrod</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;is linked to the great cities of Babel (i.e., Babylon; see note on 11:9) and Nineveh in Assyria, whose inhabitants at a later stage would descend in destructive power on the kingdoms of Israel and Judah. (ESV)</span></p><p class="c2"><span>10:21: These are the people with whom Israelites felt the most affinity, for Abraham was descended from </span><span class="c0">Shem</span><span class="c4">. Insofar as they can be identified, many of these are Arabian tribes or kingdoms. (ESV)</span></p><p class="c2"><span>10:21: </span><span class="c0">Eber</span><span>&nbsp;is mentioned even before Shem&rsquo;s own sons are named. The designation &ldquo;Hebrew&rdquo; (Hb. &lsquo;ibri; see 14:13) is derived from &ldquo;</span><span class="c0">Eber</span><span class="c4">&rdquo; (Hb. &lsquo;eber). (ESV)</span></p><h3 class="c7" id="h.1ocqj6mwsnb9"><span>The Tower of Babel</span></h3><p class="c2"><span>11:4: It is commonly believed that a Ziggurat was being built in the Tower of Babel episode: a monumental temple-tower with stairways ascending to the top of the structure where a small temple/shrine sat on the summit. They were commonly built of sun-dried mud and straw bricks held in position with bitumen as mortar, and the text indicates that the builders of Babel had discovered the process of making mud bricks and that they employed &ldquo;</span><span class="c0">bitumen for mortar</span><span class="c4">&rdquo;. Based on that invention, the builders decided &ldquo;to build &hellip; a tower with its top in the heavens&rdquo;. (ESV)</span></p><p class="c2"><span>11:4: Clearly nothing was wrong with the </span><span class="c0">city</span><span>&nbsp;and the </span><span class="c0">tower</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;itself: God was not going to delegitimize skyscrapers! There was definitely something wrong with the reasons why the tower was built, with its purpose or meaning, and originally, with the hearts of the men that have decided to build that tower, and their combined effort in achieving that wicked purpose, whatever it was. And it was wicked no doubt, judging by God&rsquo;s reaction, and remembering that &ldquo;the intention of man&#39;s heart is evil from his youth&rdquo; (Gen 8:21).</span></p><p class="c2"><span>11:4: This episode is significantly more important than its length suggests. It presents a unified humanity using all its resources to establish </span><span class="c0">a city</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;that is the antithesis of what God intended when he created the world. The tower is a symbol of human autonomy, and the city builders see themselves as determining and establishing their own destiny without any reference to the Lord. (ESV)</span></p><p class="c2"><span>11:4: The purpose of building the </span><span class="c0">city</span><span>: in order not to be </span><span class="c0">dispersed</span><span>; the purpose of building a tower: to </span><span class="c0">make a name</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;for themselves. The ultimate goals were security and praise. (ESV)</span></p><p class="c2"><span>11:4: The Babel enterprise is all about human independence and self-sufficiency apart from God. The </span><span class="c0">builders</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;believe that they have no need of God. Their technology and social unity give them confidence in their own ability. (ESV)</span></p><p class="c2"><span>11:4: Contrary to God&rsquo;s plan that people should fill the earth, the city-building project is designed to prevent the population from being </span><span class="c0">dispersed</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;over the face of the whole earth. (ESV)</span></p><p class="c2"><span>11:6: Here </span><span class="c0">God</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;clarifies His reasoning: it&rsquo;s not only that something unacceptable was going on at that moment; it&rsquo;s the path that the humans have taken that would lead them to even worse things.</span></p><p class="c2"><span>11:7: Acknowledging the potential danger of a unified, self-confident humanity (v. 6), God intervenes by </span><span class="c0">confusing their language</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;so that they cannot understand one another. This has the desired effect of dispersing the people throughout the world. (ESV)</span></p><p class="c2"><span>11:9: </span><span class="c0">Babel</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;is also the name used in the OT for the city of Babylon. As a city, Babylon symbolizes humanity&rsquo;s ambition to dethrone God and make the earth its own (see Revelation 17&ndash;18). (ESV)</span></p><h3 class="c7" id="h.xco4avbu3t81"><span>Shem&rsquo;s Descendants</span></h3><p class="c2"><span>11:28: </span><span class="c0">Ur</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;was a city with a highly developed urban culture. (ESV)</span></p><p class="c2"><span>11:31: </span><span class="c0">Terah</span><span>&nbsp;has decided to leave </span><span class="c0">Ur</span><span>&nbsp;and move to </span><span class="c0">Canaan</span><span>, the land where, as the reader knows, Hebrews are ultimately supposed to settle. It&rsquo;s not clear why Terah has decided to leave </span><span class="c0">Ur,</span><span>&nbsp;and why he has decided to </span><span class="c0">go into the land of Canaan</span><span>, but it happened only after Haran died (v. 28). Whatever the purpose was, in the middle of the road Terah has changed his mind, and the family has </span><span class="c0">settled</span><span>&nbsp;in </span><span class="c0">Haran</span><span>, &ldquo;</span><span class="c0">settled</span><span>&rdquo; meaning that he had no intention of travelling any further. He lived there until he died; it was </span><span class="c0">Abram</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;who continued the journey at the Lord&rsquo;s prompting.</span></p><p class="c2"><span>11:31: </span><span class="c0">Haran</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;is a region in the northern Mesopotamia and was an important crossroads and commercial center in the ancient Near East. This location in Turkey is now called Eskiharran, &ldquo;old Harran&rdquo;. (ESV)</span></p><p class="c2"><span>11:31: The spelling of the town name &ldquo;</span><span class="c0">Haran</span><span class="c4">&rdquo; in Hebrew is quite distinct from the name of Terah&rsquo;s third son. (ESV)</span></p><p class="c2"><span>11:32: If Abram was born when </span><span class="c0">Terah</span><span>&nbsp;was 70 years old (see v. 26), and if Abram was 75 years old when he departed for Canaan (see 12:4), then Terah </span><span class="c0">died</span><span>&nbsp;60 years after Abram&rsquo;s departure. <br>In Acts 7:4, however, Stephen says that Abram left </span><span class="c0">Haran</span><span>&nbsp;after the </span><span class="c0">death</span><span>&nbsp;of </span><span class="c0">Terah</span><span>. A simple way to resolve the chronological difficulty is to suppose that Stephen was following an alternative text (represented today in the Samaritan Pentateuch), which says that </span><span class="c0">Terah died</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;at the age of 145. (ESV)</span></p><h3 class="c7" id="h.5rt8ibvvxcxt"><span>The Call of Abram</span></h3><p class="c2"><span>12:1: God calls </span><span class="c0">Abram</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;to continue the journey that Terah, his father, had started but did not complete. (ESV)</span></p><p class="c2"><span>12:1: </span><span class="c0">God</span><span>&nbsp;calls </span><span class="c0">Abram</span><span>&nbsp;to leave his </span><span class="c0">country</span><span>&nbsp;and his </span><span class="c0">kindred</span><span>&nbsp;in part because </span><span class="c3">they were pagan</span><span>. Josh 24:2-3: &ldquo;Your fathers lived beyond the Euphrates, Terah, the father of Abraham and of Nahor; </span><span class="c3">and they served other gods</span><span class="c4">. Then I took your father Abraham from beyond the River and led him through all the land of Canaan, and made his offspring many.&rdquo;.</span></p><p class="c2"><span>12:1: The divine speech that suddenly and unexpectedly introduces this section is exceptionally important, for it sets the agenda not only for </span><span class="c0">Abram&rsquo;s</span><span>&nbsp;life but also for his descendants. The repetition of the verb </span><span class="c0">bless</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;(vv. 2-3) underscores the hope that through Abram people everywhere may experience God&rsquo;s favor, reversing the predominantly negative experience of chs. 3&ndash;11. (ESV)</span></p><p class="c2"><span>12:1: </span><span class="c0">God&rsquo;s</span><span>&nbsp;invitation to </span><span class="c0">Abram</span><span>&nbsp;challenges him to abandon the normal sources of personal identity and security: his family and </span><span class="c0">country</span><span class="c4">. To obey, Abram must abandon all that he has and trust God implicitly; all human support is largely removed. The promised outcomes are conditional on Abram&rsquo;s obedience. (ESV)</span></p><p class="c2"><span>12:2: </span><span class="c0">God&rsquo;s</span><span>&nbsp;purpose for </span><span class="c0">Abram</span><span>, that he become a great nation, stands in obvious tension with Sarai&rsquo;s barrenness and the summons to leave his homeland. </span><span class="c0">Abram</span><span>&nbsp;is challenged by </span><span class="c0">God</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;to establish a new humanity. (ESV)</span></p><p class="c2"><span>12:2: </span><span class="c0">make your name great</span><span class="c4">. This was the failed aspiration of the tower builders (11:4). (ESV)</span></p><p class="c2"><span>12:3: Although </span><span class="c0">Abram</span><span>&nbsp;is called to be a </span><span class="c0">blessing</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;to others, much rests on how they treat him. Those who are positive toward Abram will experience God&rsquo;s favor; the one who despises Abram will know God&rsquo;s displeasure. (ESV)</span></p><p class="c2"><span>12:4: The brief report of </span><span class="c0">Abram&rsquo;s</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;response presents his obedience as immediate and unquestioning. (ESV)</span></p><p class="c2"><span>12:4: Abram may have been responsible for </span><span class="c0">Lot</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;following the death of Haran (11:27&ndash;28). Since by this stage Lot is a wealthy adult with considerable possessions (vv. 5-6), readers may assume that he desires to support Abram&rsquo;s mission. (ESV)</span></p><p class="c2"><span>12:6: </span><span class="c0">Abram</span><span>&nbsp;probably camped away from urban populations; these locations are identified by distinctive natural features, e.g. </span><span class="c0">trees</span><span class="c4">. (ESV)</span></p><p class="c2"><span>12:6: </span><span class="c0">Abram</span><span>&nbsp;camped away from </span><span class="c0">Canaanites</span><span class="c4">, who are mentioned in the verse.</span></p><p class="c2"><span>12:7: </span><span class="c0">God</span><span>&nbsp;has </span><span class="c0">appeared</span><span>&nbsp;to Abram: this marvellous event must have made a deep impression on him, so he builds an </span><span class="c0">altar</span><span>&nbsp;in response to this event. The repeated words, </span><span class="c0">who had appeared to him</span><span class="c4">, may indicate that the altar commemorates the event.</span></p><p class="c2"><span>12:7: Another source of joy for </span><span class="c0">Abram</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;is that God has implicitly promised that Abraham, who was already 75 and whose wife was barren, will have children. </span></p><p class="c2"><span>12:7: This is the first of a number of manifestations of </span><span class="c0">God</span><span>&nbsp;to the patriarchs. These are often associated with divine promises. On this occasion </span><span class="c0">God</span><span>&nbsp;promises the </span><span class="c0">land</span><span>&nbsp;to the descendants of </span><span class="c0">Abram</span><span>, although he is still childless.

(ESV)</span></p><h3 class="c7" id="h.2biw3n2nw7mi"><span>Abram and Sarai in Egypt</span></h3><p class="c2"><span class="c4">12:13: The events described in this section raise many questions that go unanswered, creating a sense of ambiguity as to how the behavior of everyone involved should be judged. As is common in biblical stories, the narrator gives no direct evaluation of the participants&rsquo; actions, leaving the reader to figure out the ethical questions. (ESV)</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c4">12:13: Abram&rsquo;s selfish actions imply that he thinks God is unable to protect him. Yet when the plan backfires, it is the Lord who rescues him. (ESV)</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c4">12:13: With the assumption that Abram actually loved his wife. Which he probably did, because when she died, he &ldquo;mourned and weeped&rdquo; (Gen 23:2).<br>Abram believes that the land he enters is godless (Gen 20:11: &ldquo;Abraham said, &ldquo;I did it because I thought, &lsquo;There is no fear of God at all in this place, and they will kill me because of my wife.&rdquo;) and he doesn&rsquo;t trust God to rescue him (v. 12: &ldquo;they will kill me, but they will let you live&rdquo;), but rather, he devises his own ruse based on a half-truth even before he enters the city (v. 11: &ldquo;When he was about to enter Egypt&rdquo;; v. 13: &ldquo;Say you are my sister&rdquo;). The idea probably was that if everyone knows that she is his sister, no one would dare to take her by force (v. 13: &ldquo;my life may be spared for your sake&rdquo;): at worst, the Egyptians would propose to her, which he could safely reject. It is not known whether Abram&rsquo;s judgment was correct: perhaps, there was no danger in Egypt at all. <br>Abram must have spread the lie and lived peaceably for a while. It seemed that the plan worked fine and he had the situation under control: the Egyptians saw his wife, but did not take her from him (v. 14: &ldquo;the Egyptians saw that the woman was very beautiful&rdquo;). Many people must have known her to be his sister already, but could not have her.<br>However, something went horribly wrong: the lie that Abraham had spread finally went as far as the Pharaoh&rsquo;s house (v. 15: &ldquo;they praised her to Pharaoh&rdquo;). Possibly, that was one special marriage proposal: a proposal from the Pharaoh himself, the most powerful person in the country, which could not be rejected. Also, it was too late for Abram to change his tune and say that this sister of his, as everyone already knew her, was actually his wife. <br>The plan backfired: Abram was caught in his own lie and couldn&rsquo;t disclose to the Pharaoh that he had been lying the whole time. He must have had a horrible dilemma: tolerate his beloved wife being with the Pharaoh and keep his life; or face the very thing he had feared: be killed if the truth is revealed. God did not let Abram&rsquo;s deception work and has brought Abram to the very situation he had feared.<br>Again, Abram did not find the faith nor the courage to tell the truth and try to negotiate somehow. Perhaps, he did not even have that chance: how would anyone dare to approach the ruler of the country with a request to surrender his new wife? So Abram had to suffer the consequences. He must have hated every gift he has received from the Pharaoh for his wife that he has lost!<br>This was going on for a long while. The situation did not resolve overnight: Abram had to suffer the consequences for quite a while (v. 16: numerous gifts: &ldquo;sheep, oxen, male donkeys, male servants, female servants, female donkeys, and camels.&rdquo;). It is clear that Abram enjoyed none of the gifts he was sent. How could he!<br>After teaching Abram a hard lesson, God has acted and resolved the situation (v. 17: &ldquo;afflicted Pharaoh and his house with great plagues&rdquo;). The Pharaoh has somehow learned that Sarah was Abram&rsquo;s wife (v. 18: &ldquo;she was your wife&rdquo;): either the Pharaoh had some sort of a dream, or a prophecy, or Abram has finally found the courage to tell the truth. <br>By God&rsquo;s mercy, Abram was not punished further, however, but received his wife back. Even though there&rsquo;s no word in the text, Abram must have bitterly repented of his behavior after experiencing such a loss. <br>It is notable that God did not abandon Abram, but helped him. In the end, Abram was even more blessed with possessions because of all those gifts that the family could now keep to themselves (v. 16: &ldquo;he dealt well with Abram&rdquo;)! God did not even let the Pharaoh approach her (likely from a parallel episode in Gen 20:4: &ldquo;Now Abimelech had not approached her&rdquo;).<br>God has taught Abram a lesson that when he does not trust God and take shortcuts, he may in the end face the very thing he fears most. Unfortunately, Abram did not learn the lesson and will take another shortcut later on when he fathers his first child with a concubine.</span></p><p class="c2"><span>12:13: (translation) </span><span class="c18">&#1042; &#1087;&#1088;&#1077;&#1076;&#1087;&#1086;&#1083;&#1086;&#1078;&#1077;&#1085;&#1080;&#1080;, &#1095;&#1090;&#1086; &#1040;&#1074;&#1088;&#1072;&#1084; &#1074;&#1089;&#1105;-&#1090;&#1072;&#1082;&#1080; &#1083;&#1102;&#1073;&#1080;&#1083; &#1089;&#1074;&#1086;&#1102; &#1078;&#1077;&#1085;&#1091; (&#1072; &#1086;&#1085;&#1080; &#1073;&#1099;&#1083;&#1080; &#1084;&#1085;&#1086;&#1075;&#1086; &#1076;&#1077;&#1089;&#1103;&#1090;&#1082;&#1086;&#1074; &#1083;&#1077;&#1090; &#1074;&#1084;&#1077;&#1089;&#1090;&#1077;, &#1080; &#1086;&#1085; &#1086;&#1095;&#1077;&#1085;&#1100; &#1089;&#1082;&#1086;&#1088;&#1073;&#1077;&#1083; &#1080; &#1088;&#1099;&#1076;&#1072;&#1083; &#1082;&#1086;&#1075;&#1076;&#1072; &#1086;&#1085;&#1072; &#1091;&#1084;&#1077;&#1088;&#1083;&#1072;!

How in the world could she be </span><span class="c0">beautiful</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;at such an age? The answer may lie in her skin color: it is possible that she was more light-skinned than the Egyptians, and therefore attractive to them.</span></p><p class="c2"><span>12:16: The scarcity of </span><span class="c0">camels</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;in the period of the patriarchs made them a luxury of great worth, and thus their listing here (and elsewhere) may serve to emphasize Abram&rsquo;s wealth. (ESV)</span></p><p class="c2"><span>12:17:</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;Pharaoh&rsquo;s</span><span>&nbsp;taking of </span><span class="c0">Sarai</span><span>&nbsp;brings divine punishment on him </span><span class="c0">and his house</span><span class="c4">. This event (plagues; cf. Ex. 11:1) prefigures the exodus from Egypt when God punishes another pharaoh for his mistreatment of Abram&rsquo;s descendants.

Unlike the people of Canaan, Abram&rsquo;s family has returned with more possessions that they had had. In fact, they were very, very wealthy (v. 6: the land couldn&rsquo;t even sustain their livestock).</span></p><p class="c2"><span>13:10: Abram had given </span><span class="c0">Lot</span><span>&nbsp;the right to choose, and Lot chose a land that looked best. But danger is already looming over Lot: even though the </span><span class="c0">well-watered land</span><span>&nbsp;is almost like the </span><span class="c0">garden of the Lord</span><span>, this fertile land would soon become home to such wickedness that </span><span class="c0">the Lord</span><span>&nbsp;himself would destroy it.<br>It must be to emphasize the futility of Lot&rsquo;s choice that the author has chosen to remind the reader of the fate of </span><span class="c0">Sodom</span><span>&nbsp;in this verse. It must be that Lot chose the land himself, without inquiring God about the best choice. </span><span class="c0">Abram, </span><span class="c4">however, has inquired (v. 4: &ldquo;called upon the name of the Lord&rdquo;).</span></p><p class="c2"><span>13:10: This remark is probably given to inform the reader that the land that he knows is currently barren used to be fertile in the times before </span><span class="c0">Sodom and Gomorrah</span><span>&nbsp;were </span><span class="c0">destroyed</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;with fire and brimstone, which may have adversely affected the suitability of this area for flocks and herds. (ESV)</span></p><p class="c2"><span>13:13: Lot has chosen the land that was fertile, but was also home to </span><span class="c0">great wickedness</span><span class="c4">. The side note given here probably hints at the unreasonableness of Lot&rsquo;s choice which was done not by faith but by sight.</span></p><p class="c2"><span>13:12-13: At first Lot may not have known what sort of people lived in </span><span class="c0">Sodom</span><span>&nbsp;(v. 13: &ldquo;wicked&rdquo;, &ldquo;great sinners&rdquo;), but we also see that he used to live in tents (v. 12: &ldquo;moved his tent&rdquo;) at first, and moved closer and closer to </span><span class="c0">Sodom</span><span class="c4">. Lot is later found living in the city (Gen 14:12), having abandoned his tent-dwelling lifestyle. This move indicates that he willingly chose to live among those wicked people, perhaps, for the sake of his business or comfort.</span></p><p class="c2"><span>13:14: Even though the land that </span><span class="c0">Abram</span><span>&nbsp;was left with did not look that good, it was the land on which </span><span class="c0">the Lord</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;promises that Abram&rsquo;s descendants will live and become a great nation. A choice that seems to be inferior may become superior by God&rsquo;s power for a person who follows God&rsquo;s guidance and not his own wisdom. </span></p><p class="c2"><span>13:16: God promises Abram numerous </span><span class="c0">offspring</span><span class="c4">. At this stage, Abram still has no children. (ESV)</span></p><p class="c2"><span>13:18: A cuneiform tablet discovered there from this time period indicates that </span><span class="c0">Hebron</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;was a capital city of a Canaanite kingdom. (ESV)</span></p><p class="c2"><span>13:18: Repeated mentions of </span><span class="c0">building altars to the Lord</span><span>&nbsp;indicates that even though </span><span class="c0">Abram&rsquo;s</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;faith had stumbled while in Egypt, he worships God. This involves trusting God and following Him now, especially remembering that it was by God&rsquo;s mercy that he&rsquo;s received his wife back.</span></p><h3 class="c7" id="h.zex36a33yvw6"><span>Abram Rescues Lot and is blessed by Melchizedek</span></h3><p class="c2"><span>14:2: </span><span class="c0">Sodom and Gomorrah</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;is precisely the place where Lot has settled after separating with Abraham. The area is now invaded by an alliance of four kings who defeat a local confederation of five kings and take Lot captive. (ESV)</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c4">14:3: Such alliances were a common and recurring aspect of politics in the ancient Near East. (ESV)</span></p><p class="c2"><span>14:13: This is the first occurrence of the term &ldquo;</span><span class="c0">Hebrew</span><span>&rdquo; in the Bible and is probably used here to denote the ethnicity of </span><span class="c0">Abram</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;(ESV)</span></p><p class="c2"><span>14:15: A </span><span class="c0">nighttime</span><span>&nbsp;assault gives </span><span class="c0">Abram</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;an advantage. (ESV)</span></p><p class="c2"><span>14:15: This episode provides an interesting insight into his future aspirations in light of God&rsquo;s promises of the land. Although </span><span class="c0">Abram</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;can compete militarily against powerful kings, he rejects the use of power to achieve God&rsquo;s purpose. Thus he does not use force to take control of the land of Canaan. The patriarch will not adopt violent strategies in order to obtain it. (ESV)</span></p><p class="c2"><span>14:18: </span><span class="c0">Melchizedek</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;(which means &ldquo;king of righteousness&rdquo;; Heb. 7:2: &ldquo;He is first, by translation of his name, king of righteousness, and then he is also king of Salem, that is, king of peace.&rdquo;) generously provides a meal for the returning victors. (ESV)</span></p><p class="c2"><span>14:18: </span><span class="c0">Salem</span><span>&nbsp;is possibly a shortened version of &ldquo;Jerusalem&rdquo; (Ps. 76:2: God&rsquo;s &ldquo;abode has been established in Salem&rdquo;) and is related to </span><span class="c3">shalom</span><span class="c4">, the Hebrew word for &ldquo;peace&rdquo;. (ESV)</span></p><p class="c2"><span>14:18: </span><span class="c0">Melchizedek</span><span>&nbsp;is then a </span><span class="c0">priest-king</span><span>&nbsp;of Jerusalem. There appears to have been an expectation that later </span><span class="c0">kings of Jerusalem</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;should resemble him (Ps. 110:4: &ldquo;You are a priest forever after the order of Melchizedek.&rdquo;). The book of Hebrews presents Jesus Christ, from the royal line of David, as belonging to the &ldquo;order of Melchizedek&rdquo; and therefore superior to the Levitical priests (Heb. 5:5&ndash;10: &ldquo;&ldquo;You are a priest forever, after the order of Melchizedek.&ldquo;; 6:20&ndash;7:17). (ESV)</span></p><p class="c2"><span>14:18: </span><span class="c0">God Most High</span><span>: Heb. </span><span class="c3">&rsquo;El &lsquo;Elyon</span><span class="c4">. (ESV)</span></p><p class="c2"><span>14:20: Melchizedek&rsquo;s blessing attributes Abram&rsquo;s victory to the power of </span><span class="c0">God</span><span>. By giving a </span><span class="c0">tenth</span><span>, </span><span class="c0">Abram</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;affirms the truthfulness of Melchizedek&rsquo;s words. (ESV)</span></p><p class="c2"><span>14:23: </span><span class="c0">Abram</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;affirms that he is depending on God and not on human kings or their gifts in order to become a &ldquo;great nation&rdquo; and acquire a great name. (ESV)</span></p><h3 class="c7" id="h.krbt0jz5smh"><span>God&rsquo;s Covenant with Abram</span></h3><p class="c2"><span>15:1: </span><span class="c0">After these things.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span class="c0">Abram</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;rejected the offer from the king of Sodom for the victory spoils as a reward. In response, God now states that Abram&rsquo;s reward shall be very great. By rejecting the use of human wealth to achieve greatness, Abram demonstrates his willingness to wait for God to provide. (ESV)</span></p><p class="c2"><span>15:2: </span><span class="c0">Eliezer</span><span>&nbsp;(means, God is help) is a trusted member of Abram&rsquo;s household, possibly a slave, who came from </span><span class="c0">Damascus</span><span class="c4">. (ESV)</span></p><p class="c2"><span>15:6: Faith in God entails trust in or confident reliance on God, based on the truthfulness of his words, and it will lead to obeying his commands. A person&rsquo;s faith, or lack of it, is most apparent in crises such as Abram was facing. </span><span class="c0">He believed God</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;would give him a son despite many years of childlessness. (ESV)</span></p><p class="c2"><span>15:6: &ldquo;</span><span class="c0">Righteousness</span><span class="c4">&rdquo; is the fundamental OT virtue characterized by a godly life lived in conformity with the law. It is the righteous who enjoy God&rsquo;s favor. Abram has proved himself righteous by his deeds, he is counted (that is, regarded) as righteous because of his faith. (ESV)</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c4">15:10: This is possibly a type of oath that makes a party who breaks it like one of those dead animals (Jer 34:18-19: &ldquo;the men who transgressed ... I will make them like the calf that they cut in two and passed between its parts&rdquo;). In this case, it is God Who&rsquo;s giving the deadly oath. (ESV)</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c4">15:10: Another interpretation is that the sacrificial animals symbolize Abram&rsquo;s descendants (all of Israel), the &ldquo;birds of prey&rdquo; signify their enemies (unclean nations), and the &ldquo;fire pot&rdquo; and &ldquo;torch&rdquo; represent God&rsquo;s presence. (ESV)</span></p><p class="c2"><span>15:16: </span><span class="c0">Amorites</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;were the descendants of Ham (Gen 10:16). The Amorites will be dispossessed of their land as an act of divine punishment. At that time, their accumulated iniquity will be so great that God will no longer tolerate their presence in the land. (ESV)</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c4">15:18: God unconditionally pledges that Abram&rsquo;s offspring will possess this land. (ESV)</span></p><h3 class="c7" id="h.ljncfbargr1z"><span class="c11 c0">Sarai and Hagar</span></h3><p class="c2"><span>16:1: Years and years have passed after God has first promised Abram </span><span class="c0">children</span><span class="c4">, and 11 years have passed after Abram settled in Canaan, and Sarai was unable to bear any children to Abram. No doubt, they have tried, but she was barren (Gen 11:30). Abram&rsquo;s confidence must have faded, because everything looked like it was impossible to have children with her. Especially after all these years. Especially considering their age. Impossible.</span></p><p class="c2"><span>16:2: Even though it was </span><span class="c0">The Lord</span><span>&nbsp;Who has promised </span><span class="c0">children</span><span>&nbsp;to Abram, Sarai emphasized that it was the same </span><span class="c0">Lord</span><span>&nbsp;Who </span><span class="c0">prevented her from bearing children</span><span class="c4">. She either was bitter with the Lord and so blamed Him with being unable to deliver His promise, or she thought that they are to achieve the promise by themselves. Either way, that was a lack of faith. </span></p><p class="c2"><span>16:2: </span><span class="c0">Abram</span><span>&nbsp;had previously refused to pursue God&rsquo;s promises by his own means: he did not think that the promised land is his anyway and so he&rsquo;s free to take it by force; He had waited on the Lord to deliver the land to him. But when it came to </span><span class="c0">children</span><span>, he didn&rsquo;t trust the Lord anymore and </span><span class="c0">listened to the voice</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;of his wife.</span></p><p class="c2"><span>16:2: </span><span class="c0">Bearing a child</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;on behalf of a barren woman was a custom mentioned in other ancient Near Eastern texts. (ESV)</span></p><p class="c2"><span>16:3: Hagar&rsquo;s status within Abram&rsquo;s household is changed from servant to </span><span class="c0">wife</span><span class="c4">, although this does not place her on a par with Sarai (see note on 25:5&ndash;6). While the OT records occasions when particular individuals have more than one wife, such instances are almost always fraught with complications and difficulties. (ESV)</span></p><p class="c2"><span>16:4: </span><span class="c0">Hagar&rsquo;s</span><span>&nbsp;ability to conceive causes her to </span><span class="c0">look down on</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;Sarai. (ESV)</span></p><p class="c2"><span>16:5: </span><span class="c0">Sarai</span><span>&nbsp;initially directs her anger at </span><span class="c0">Abram</span><span>, who acquiesces in the situation, permitting Sarai to deal </span><span class="c0">harshly</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;with Hagar. The human solution to Sarai&rsquo;s barrenness creates new problems. (ESV)</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c4">16:5: It is clear from this episode that trying to achieve God&rsquo;s will by human means leads to problems, not to blessedness. God will do His will in His time; not in our time.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c4">16:7: Hagar&rsquo;s flight takes her in the direction of Egypt, her homeland. (ESV)</span></p><p class="c2"><span>16:7: By sending an </span><span class="c0">angel-messenger</span><span class="c4">, the Lord persuades Hagar to return, probably thus leading Abram to think that the child soon to be born, Ishmael, might indeed be the promised son (Gen 16:7: &ldquo;Abraham said to God, &ldquo;Oh that Ishmael might live before you!&rdquo;&rdquo;) (ESV).</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c4">16:7: Theologically, this episode emphasizes the hearing and seeing nature of God, and his mercy. (ESV)</span></p><p class="c2"><span>16:9: Hagar is commanded by God to transform her attitude toward her </span><span class="c0">mistress</span><span>, Sarai; instead of despising her, she is to </span><span class="c0">submit to her</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;authority.

It is of significant medical importance that male circumcision be carried out on the eighth day after birth since the level of vitamin K is highest on this day and vitamin K plays a pivotal role in regulation and control of the important clotting factors in the coagulation pathway that helps in stopping bleeding. The &nbsp;Vitamin &nbsp;K &nbsp;and &nbsp;Thrombocin &nbsp;(which &nbsp;is &nbsp;a blood clotter) are the highest &nbsp;in a &nbsp;baby on his eighth day of life, and together with prothrombin, are essential &nbsp;for &nbsp;the function &nbsp;of &nbsp;several proteins &nbsp;involved in blood coagulation. It is essential that circumcision is done on that very day.

In Hebrew, Abraham properly says </span><span class="c3">Adonai</span><span>, which is used for God in the OT.

No doubt, Abraham has recognized that these visitors are a divine manifestation.

In v.13, the Lord talks about Sarah, knowing her thoughts, and in v.15 she engages in the conversation. <br>So, either Sarah was in the tent but still visible from the dining place, or she must have come out of the tent to say the words to the Lord.<br>Either way, she was not at the table.</span></p><p class="c2"><span>18:12: </span><span class="c0">Sarah laughed</span><span class="c4">.

As often in the OT, the author does not judge, but merely reports. Even though it was </span><span class="c0">out of fear</span><span>, it is clear in this episode that Sarah exhibits her sin nature by denying the responsibility just like the first couple did before God. But God knows the truth: &ldquo;</span><span class="c0">no, but you did laugh</span><span>&rdquo;.<br>At the same time, </span><span class="c0">Sarah</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;had faith, because it is &ldquo;by faith [that she has] received power to conceive&rdquo; (Heb 11:11).</span></p><p class="c2"><span>18:19: God&rsquo;s </span><span class="c0">promise</span><span>&nbsp;is conditional upon </span><span class="c0">Abraham</span><span>&rsquo;s descendants&rsquo; </span><span class="c0">keeping the way of the Lord</span><span>, and that is, </span><span class="c0">by doing righteousness and justice</span><span class="c4">: something that the believing Jews of the distant future will forget.</span></p><h3 class="c7" id="h.46bgs1r7cxad"><span class="c11 c0">The Destruction of Sodom</span></h3><p class="c2"><span class="c4">18:21: These words reveal that the decision to destroy the cities of the plain was undertaken with careful scrutiny of the evidence. All that is implied is God&rsquo;s direct attention to the matter. (ESV)</span></p><p class="c2"><span>18:22: It is now clear from this verse, and from 19:1, that only one of the </span><span class="c0">men</span><span>&nbsp;was </span><span class="c0">The Lord</span><span>, but the other two were angels (19:1: &ldquo;the two angels&rdquo;).

He did not change His mind between the verses; as often in the OT, angels often speak and act for God, and God is often represented by angels who can give a direct speech on God&rsquo;s behalf, using an &ldquo;I&rdquo; that stands for &ldquo;I, God&rdquo;.<br>Here, it is clear that God sends angels to see and to act, and angels act and speak as if God Himself acts and speaks through them.

(ESV)</span></p><p class="c2"><span>18:25: </span><span class="c0">Abraham</span><span>&nbsp;couldn&rsquo;t believe that God, who has just promised to carefully evaluate the evidence (v.21), will so plainly go against His Own Nature of a </span><span class="c0">just judge</span><span class="c4">.</span></p><p class="c2"><span>18:25: </span><span class="c0">Abraham</span><span>&nbsp;knows, he knows, that </span><span class="c0">God</span><span>&nbsp;must be true to His nature. (ESV)</span></p><p class="c2"><span>18:25: It is clear that Abraham does not see God merely being in a position of a </span><span class="c0">judge</span><span>, but he sees God as a </span><span class="c0">just judge</span><span class="c4">, doing what is right. God will never misuse His power, but will always do what is right.</span></p><p class="c2"><span>18:26: Abraham has just said what may be seen as outspoken questioning of the sovereign Lord and indignation at what he thought was about to happen. &ldquo;</span><span class="c0">Far be it from you</span><span>!&rdquo; does not sound like something you say to God.<br>Interestingly, </span><span class="c0">The Lord</span><span>&nbsp;does not rebuke such a blunt statement, but </span><span class="c0">answers</span><span class="c4">. After all, God Himself opened the possibility for that conversation by deciding to reveal to Abraham what He was about to do (v. 17).</span></p><p class="c2"><span>18:27: </span><span class="c0">Abraham</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;speaks those words of humility before God whom he dared to question. When he had first asked God, there was no humility, but rather, questioning. <br>Perhaps, now Abraham&rsquo;s indignation has settled down, and he started talking the way he should have from the very beginning. Perhaps this is why God was so patient with Abraham&rsquo;s outburst: God who knows the future surely knows that Abraham did not mean what his words looked like.</span></p><p class="c2"><span>18:32: From the following events it becomes clear that there were not even </span><span class="c0">ten righteous people</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;in the town of Sodom. At least, those that were there, God has led away from the city, for He has promised that He will not destroy the righteous with the wicked.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c4">18:32: Abraham does not dare to keep reducing the number, although logically, there must have been the final question: &ldquo;What about if there is one rigteous person in the city; will you destroy the righteous with the wicked?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c4">18:32: Abraham may have ceased engaging in the conversation out of reverence, or maybe, because the principle has already been established: God will not punish the righteous along with the wicked.</span></p><p class="c2"><span>18:33: </span><span class="c0">The Lord</span><span>&nbsp;does not go to Sodom, but </span><span class="c0">went his way</span><span class="c4">: left the place altogether. Only the two angels reached Sodom.</span></p><p class="c2"><span>18:33: </span><span class="c0">Abraham</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;also returned to his place. It is notorious that he did not go to see what would happen to Sodom. He has just talked with God Himself, he still trusts Him, and trusts so much that there is no need to go and see for yourself. If the Lord has said, &ldquo;I will not destroy the wicked with the righteous&rdquo;, then it will be so. (Gen 15:6: &ldquo;he believed the LORD, and jhe counted it to him as righteousness&rdquo;). </span></p><p class="c2"><span>19:1: Three men had come to the Abraham&rsquo;s place (Gen 18:2), and Abraham had called them &ldquo;The Lord&rdquo;.

By resembling Abraham, Lot demonstrates that he is righteous. (ESV)</span></p><p class="c2"><span>19:3: </span><span class="c0">Pressed them strongly</span><span class="c4">.

The news about the newcomers have spread quickly: it was &ldquo;evening&rdquo; (v. 1) when they came. It took the whole city a few hours to spread the news, decide, and gather </span><span class="c0">all the people to the last man</span><span class="c4">. Was it customary to greet strangers like this? Perhaps, Lot knew about this custom, and this was one of the reasons why he had invited those angels?</span></p><p class="c2"><span>19:4: </span><span class="c0">All the people</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;have become a gang seeking an orgy of rape.

(ESV)</span></p><p class="c2"><span>19:5: </span><span class="c0">Know them</span><span class="c4">. Lot&rsquo;s earlier insistence (v. 3) that the visitors should not spend the night in the square indicates that he feared for their safety.

By addressing some of the people as </span><span class="c0">brothers</span><span>, he is showing his connection with them. Even though he does not participate in their wickedness to the same extent, Lot has gotten attached to the city and its people. Perhaps, there were some close friends whom he called </span><span class="c0">brothers</span><span class="c4">.</span></p><p class="c2"><span>19:8: </span><span class="c0">Let me bring you my daughters</span><span class="c4">. In desperation he offers his two unmarried daughters as substitutes: a shocking, cowardly, and inexcusable act (even if he intended this only as a bluff, or expected the offer to be rejected). The reaction of the crowd only confirms the truly evil nature of their intentions. (ESV)</span></p><p class="c2"><span>19:8: </span><span class="c0">Let me bring you my daughters</span><span class="c4">. In Judg 19:24, Gibeah offered his concubine to a gang of worthless people looking for gay sex at the threshold of his house. She died from that abuse, but the husband did not seem to care.</span></p><p class="c2"><span>19:8: </span><span class="c0">Let me bring you my daughters</span><span class="c4">. It is true, of two evils we must choose the less, but of two sins we must choose neither, nor ever do evil that good may come of it. (Benson commentary)</span></p><p class="c2"><span>19:8: </span><span class="c0">Only do nothing to these men</span><span class="c4">. Lot&rsquo;s exhibits perverted judgment: he sees great evil in sodomy, but sees only a lesser, an acceptable perhaps, evil, in the abuse of his both daughters. His actions flow from great charity: a strong desire to protect his guests, even in the face of danger; but due to some perverted judgment, Lot&rsquo;s love results in a most imprudent and sinful motion, whereby he yielded to one sin to prevent another, contrary to Romans 3:8 (&ldquo;Let us do evil that good may come? &hellip; Their condemnation is just.&rdquo;).</span></p><p class="c2"><span>19:12: (</span><span class="c1">Lot&rsquo;s righteousness</span><span>) The NT tells us that </span><span class="c0">Lot</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;was a righteous man (2 Peter 2:7-8: &ldquo;righteous man&hellip;, he was tormenting his righteous soul over their lawless deeds that he saw and heard&rdquo;). This also clear here because God has promised not to destroy the righteous with the wicked, so He warns the righteous.</span></p><p class="c2"><span>19:12: (</span><span class="c1">Lot&rsquo;s righteousness</span><span>) </span><span class="c0">Lot</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;was righteous only relatively; and though his soul was daily vexed by what he saw, it was not vexed enough to make him quit such evil surroundings, and return to the healthy and virtuous life of the mountains. And, when finally he sought refuge in them, as it was not of his own free will, but on compulsion (v. 30). <br>The warning of his fall is, that men who part with religious privileges for the sake of worldly advantage are in danger of sinking into moral degradation, and of losing, with their faith and hope, not only their self-respect and happiness, but even that earthly profit for the sake of which they sacrificed their religion.<br>(Ellicott&#39;s Commentary)</span></p><p class="c2"><span>19:12: While </span><span class="c0">Lot</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;was righteous, some of his family were not (cf. the conduct or his daughters in v.32). God still gave Lot the possibility to take the whole family with him. Why?<br>First of all, it was a test: if Lot had a particular dislike for one of his in-laws, he might have had a temptation to leave that person behind. But Lot went out to want his sons-in-law (v. 14).<br>Secondly, family ties: God recognizes that family ties are important for a person, and offers Lot a possibility to take his unrighteous family with him, just as He let Noah take some of his unrighteous family members (i.e. Ham).<br>Thirdly, the possibility to witness a denial: God gives Lot the possibility to see for himself how his sons-in-law reject the salvation he offered (v. 14). It may well be that it was not the first time that they mocked his faith in an invisible God. They would have taken Lot&rsquo;s words seriously otherwise.</span></p><p class="c2"><span>19:13: </span><span class="c0">The outcry against its people has become great</span><span class="c4">. It is a recurring theme in the Bible that before God takes action, the measure of sins has to exceed a certain threshold, &ldquo;be complete&rdquo;. (Gen 15:16: &quot;the iniquity of the Amorites is not yet complete.&rdquo;; Dan 8:23: &ldquo;when the transgressors have reached their limit&rdquo;).</span></p><p class="c2"><span>19:14: Those two </span><span class="c0">sons-in-law</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;were unrighteous people, because they were ultimately destroyed together with the rest. Lot has given his daughters in marriage to unrighteous people.</span></p><p class="c2"><span>19:15: </span><span class="c0">Your wife and your two daughters</span><span>. After Lot has heard the denial himself, </span><span class="c0">the angels</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;do not urge him to take them anymore. </span></p><p class="c2"><span>19:16: </span><span class="c0">But he lingered</span><span>. There is no doubt that that Lot has taken the warning seriously, for he was speaking about the looming doom to other people. There was something dear to him in this town that he could not leave that easily.<br>Whatever that was that held him, it was likely either sinful or foolish, because God has led his family out &ldquo;</span><span class="c0">being merciful to him</span><span class="c4">&rdquo;, which indicates forgiveness.</span></p><p class="c2"><span>19:16: </span><span class="c0">But he lingered</span><span>. This verse may mean that it was not Lot himself who was </span><span class="c0">lingering</span><span>, but his daughters. After all, Lot had to convince them too: two young betrothed girls whose bridegrooms were to remain and die in the flames.<br>Thus, &ldquo;he&rdquo; may mean &ldquo;them&rdquo;, i.e. the whole family, just like &ldquo;</span><span class="c0">they brought him out and set him outside the city</span><span class="c4">&rdquo; means &ldquo;they brought them and set them&rdquo;.</span></p><p class="c2"><span>19:17: </span><span class="c0">They brought them out</span><span class="c4">. By interchanging &ldquo;him&rdquo; and &ldquo;them&rdquo;, the text shows that the head of the family is identified with the whole family.</span></p><p class="c2"><span>19:17: </span><span class="c0">Do not look back</span><span class="c4">. Another indication of some strong attachment that Lot has developed to that place or something in it.</span></p><p class="c2"><span>19:21: </span><span class="c0">I grant you this favor</span><span class="c4">. God resolved to keep the town intact, even though the original plan was to destroy it. Some of the wicked go on living because of a single request of a righteous person.</span></p><p class="c2"><span>19:21: </span><span class="c0">I grant you this favor</span><span class="c4">. This is a case of a righteous person interceding for the unrighteous, and God hearing the request.</span></p><p class="c2"><span>19:22: </span><span class="c0">I can do nothing till you arrive there</span><span class="c4">. God cannot destroy the righteous with the wicked.</span></p><p class="c2"><span>19:23: </span><span class="c0">The sun had risen</span><span class="c4">. The angels had come to Sodom in the evening (v. 1)</span></p><p class="c2"><span>19:26: </span><span class="c0">Looked back</span><span class="c4">. She disobeyed God&rsquo;s commandment, and in doing so, demonstrated her attachment to the city of the wicked. There was something in it that she loved even more than Lot had.</span></p><p class="c2"><span>19:27: </span><span class="c0">To the place</span><span>. After having pleaded with </span><span class="c0">the Lord</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;for the righteous in Sodom, Abraham went home: he saw no reason to sit and wait, like Johan would have. The evening came, the night has passed, and only in the morning (v. 23) the destruction came.</span></p><p class="c2"><span>19:28: </span><span class="c0">And he looked down</span><span class="c4">. He did not yet know for sure that Lot, his nephew, was alive. It was only by faith that he could believe that God wouldn&rsquo;t destroy the whole city.</span></p><p class="c2"><span>19:29: </span><span class="c0">God remembered Abraham and sent Lot out</span><span class="c4">. The Bible draws a clear connection between Abraham&rsquo;s intercession for the righteous of Sodom and God&rsquo;s saving of their lives. Even though Abraham&rsquo;s pleading was in line with God&rsquo;s own will, Abraham&rsquo;s &ldquo;prayer&rdquo; was somehow counted.</span></p><p class="c2"><span>19:21: </span><span class="c0">God remembered Abraham and sent Lot out</span><span class="c4">. This is a case of a righteous person interceding for another righteous person, and God fulfilling the request.</span></p><p class="c2"><span>19:30: </span><span class="c0">Zoar</span><span class="c4">. This town, Zoar, was to be destroyed, and has only been saved due to Lot&rsquo;s intercession. It is full of wicked people, just like Sodom. </span></p><p class="c2"><span>19:30: </span><span class="c0">Afraid to live in Zoar</span><span>. Why afraid? 1) Lot may have been afraid for his daughters&rsquo; chastity. 2) He was afraid that people may learn that he had played a role in the destruction of Sodom. 3) He simply feared that God&rsquo;s judgment may proceed and consume Zoar as well.<br>The </span><span class="c0">fear</span><span>&nbsp;was sufficiently strong to drive the whole family into a distant </span><span class="c0">cave</span><span class="c4">.</span></p><p class="c2"><span>19:31: </span><span class="c0">Not a man on earth to come in to us</span><span class="c4">. Why did they say so? 1) Looking at the smoking brimstone down in the valley, they may have thought that the whole world have come to an end. 2) They may have thought that Zoar would be destroyed as well. 3) There may have been something wrong with the men of Zoar. Homosexuals? 4) Lot may have prohibited them from looking at the men of Zoar, for they were wicked.</span></p><p class="c2"><span>19:31: </span><span class="c0">Not a man on earth to come in to us</span><span class="c4">. Lot&rsquo;s two daughters fear that the isolated location chosen by their father will prevent them from having husbands. (ESV)</span></p><p class="c2"><span>19:38: </span><span class="c0">The Moabites</span><span>&nbsp;and </span><span class="c0">the ammonites</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;would become Israel&rsquo;s enemies.</span></p><p class="c2"><span>19:38: Throughout the Bible, </span><span class="c0">the Ammonites</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;and Israelites are portrayed as mutual antagonists. During the Exodus, the Israelites were prohibited by the Ammonites from passing through their lands. The Ammonites soon allied themselves with Eglon of Moab in attacking Israel. (Wikipedia)</span></p><h3 class="c7" id="h.2vib8l9ao2ig"><span class="c11 c0">Abraham and Abimelech</span></h3><p class="c2"><span>20:2: Sarah is pregnant, and </span><span class="c0">Abimelech&rsquo;s</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;actions put in jeopardy the fulfillment of God&rsquo;s promise to Abraham that Sarah will bear him a son. (ESV)</span></p><p class="c2"><span>20:2: Evidently </span><span class="c0">Sarah</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;looked much younger than her real age. (ESV)</span></p><p class="c2"><span>20:2: </span><span class="c0">Abimelech</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;means &ldquo;my father is king,&rdquo; appears to have been a common royal name. The same name is mentioned in ch. 26 (see note on 26:1&ndash;2) and is given to later biblical figures. (ESV)</span></p><p class="c2"><span>20:4: </span><span class="c0">Had not approached her</span><span class="c4">. This episode emphasizes in a variety of ways the important point that Sarah has not had intercourse with the king; otherwise, Abimelech could be the father of the son born to Sarah. (ESV)</span></p><p class="c2"><span>20:4-5: </span><span class="c0">Abimelech</span><span>&nbsp;must be a believer in </span><span class="c0">God</span><span>, because he calls Him </span><span class="c0">Lord</span><span>&nbsp;and talks about </span><span class="c0">integrity</span><span>&nbsp;and </span><span class="c0">innocence</span><span class="c4">: words of a man who can tell right from wrong.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c4">20:6: God has orchestrated some circumstances that Abimelech did not lie with Sarah. He could already have.</span></p><p class="c2"><span>20:7: </span><span class="c0">And all who are yours</span><span class="c4">. It is interesting how God is going to punish the whole kingdom for the sin of the king. This pattern proceeds through the OT, where the king is not only responsible for the kingdom, not only its representative, but also one with the kingdom &mdash; in both his vices and virtues.</span></p><p class="c2"><span>20:7: </span><span class="c0">Abraham</span><span>&nbsp;is the first person called </span><span class="c0">a prophet</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;in the OT. (ESV)</span></p><p class="c2"><span>20:7: The emphasis here is that </span><span class="c0">Abraham</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;can intercede on behalf of others. God wants a person to ask Him to do something, even though it is according to His will.</span></p><p class="c2"><span>20:11: </span><span class="c0">No fear of God in this place</span><span class="c4">. Abraham now provides the reason he acted the same way in Egypt.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c4">20:12: Abraham reveals now, for the first time, that his words were not complete lies, but half-truth. He knew, however, that his half-truth will be misleading to others.</span></p><p class="c2"><span>20:13: </span><span class="c0">At every place to which we come</span><span class="c4">. This is the strategy they&rsquo;ve chosen to employ in every land they visit. Even after the experience of Egypt, they did not learn not to act like that. Later, Abraham&rsquo;s son does the very same thing.</span></p><p class="c2"><span>20:11: </span><span class="c0">There is no fear of God at all in this place</span><span class="c4">. Abraham&rsquo;s response betrays both his lack of faith in God and his misjudgment of the people of Gerar. The whole episode reveals that the king and his servants were God-fearing. (ESV)</span></p><p class="c2"><span>20:15: </span><span class="c0">My land is before you</span><span>. Abraham had wronged </span><span class="c0">Abimelech</span><span class="c4">, but the king, who is innocent, shows generosity to Abraham. Kings&rsquo;s actions contrast sharply with Abraham&rsquo;s self-serving deception. (ESV)</span></p><h3 class="c7" id="h.kle9t1ea2106"><span class="c11 c0">The Birth of Isaac </span></h3><p class="c2"><span>21:1: </span><span class="c0">The LORD</span><span>&nbsp;had said, &ldquo;I will surely return to you about this time next year, and Sarah your wife shall have a son.&rdquo;. He did not just promise that she will conceive, but He promised </span><span class="c3">to return</span><span>. And He </span><span class="c0">visited</span><span>&nbsp;Sarah somehow, but no details are given.</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;(Gen 18:10)</span></p><p class="c2"><span>21:2: </span><span class="c0">In his old age</span><span>&nbsp;emphasizes that </span><span class="c0">Abraham</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;was not able to have children anymore, so the child was born by God&rsquo;s miracle. Rom 4:19 says that &ldquo;his own body &hellip; was as good as dead&rdquo;.<br>Abraham, however, was able to have more children after Sarah died. Probably, God has permanently returned Abraham his fertility.</span></p><p class="c2"><span>21:3: </span><span class="c0">Isaac</span><span>. God had said to call the son like that (Gen 17:19) because Sarah, who had been barren her whole life, </span><span class="c0">laughed</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;at God&rsquo;s promise of a child in her old age.</span></p><p class="c2"><span>21:4: </span><span class="c0">As God had commanded him</span><span>. Commanded one year before Isaac was born. </span><span class="c0">Abraham</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;now exhibits obedience to the Lord who has just made His promise a reality.</span></p><p class="c2"><span>21:6: </span><span class="c0">Laughter</span><span>&nbsp;of disbelief has turned into a </span><span class="c0">laughter</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;of joy.</span></p><p class="c2"><span>21:7: </span><span class="c0">Sarah</span><span class="c4">&rsquo;s words emphasize the impossible nature of what God has just done. A miracle. Impossible.</span></p><p class="c2"><span>21:8: </span><span class="c0">Weaned</span><span class="c4">. Isaac was 2 or 3 years old already.</span></p><p class="c2"><span>21:9: </span><span class="c0">The son of Hagar</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;was already 16 years old at the time.</span></p><p class="c2"><span>21:9: That </span><span class="c0">laughing</span><span>&nbsp;was some sort of evil mocking. Gal 4:29 say that the son of Hagar actually &ldquo;persecuted him who was born&rdquo;, meaning some sort of abuse and mistreatment. </span><span class="c0">Laughing</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;was probably just one of the many ways Ismael persecuted Isaac.</span></p><p class="c2"><span>21:9: The word &ldquo;</span><span class="c0">laughing</span><span>&rdquo; is ambiguous, and possibly favors &ldquo;mocking&rdquo;. </span><span class="c0">Ishmael</span><span>&nbsp;was probably </span><span class="c0">making fun</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;of Isaac&rsquo;s role as Abraham&rsquo;s promised son. (ESV)</span></p><p class="c2"><span>21:10: </span><span class="c0">Sarah</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;is being cruel, but protective of her own child.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c4">21:10: Abraham&rsquo;s desire to fulfill the Lord&rsquo;s promise by his own means has already started to bring trouble.</span></p><p class="c2"><span>21:11: </span><span class="c0">On account of his son</span><span>. Abraham still viewed Ishmael as his own firstborn son and heir, and so was </span><span class="c0">displeased</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;of the tension in the family. The inheritance of God&rsquo;s promise is clearly the issue here, because in the following verse God&rsquo;s explanation rests on the naming of Isaac as the firstborn, the son of the promise.</span></p><p class="c2"><span>21:12: </span><span class="c0">do as she tells you</span><span class="c4">. While Abraham is reluctant to send Ishmael away, God reassures him that this is for the best. (ESV)</span></p><p class="c2"><span>21:12: </span><span class="c0">Through Isaac shall your offspring be named</span><span>. Even though </span><span class="c0">Ishmael</span><span>&nbsp;is older than </span><span class="c0">Isaac</span><span>, God confirms that </span><span class="c0">Isaac</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;will take priority over Ishmael. The importance of this is picked up in Rom 9:7-8: &ldquo;and not all are children of Abraham because they are his offspring, but &ldquo;Through Isaac shall your offspring be named.&rdquo; This means that it is not the children of the flesh who are the children of God, but the children of the promise are counted as offspring&rdquo;. (ESV)</span></p><p class="c2"><span>21:16: </span><span class="c0">The child</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;was already 16 years old.</span></p><p class="c2"><span>21:17: </span><span class="c0">God heard the voice of the boy</span><span class="c4">. Although this passage avoids using his personal name, &ldquo;Ishmael&rdquo; means &ldquo;God hears&rdquo; (ESV)</span></p><h3 class="c7" id="h.ig8r82r994qc"><span class="c11 c0">A Treaty with Abimelech</span></h3><p class="c2"><span>21:22: </span><span class="c0">God is with you in all that you do</span><span class="c4">. No wonder: his house had been punished because of Sarah, and even God spoke to him personally saying that Abraham is a prophet. And now Abimelech sees an old man making children with an equally old lady, and attributing the glory for that to God! That man is full of miracles.</span></p><p class="c2"><span>21:22: </span><span class="c0">God is with you in all that you do</span><span class="c4">. Abimelech attributes Abraham&rsquo;s success to God. (ESV)</span></p><p class="c2"><span>21:23: </span><span class="c0">Swear to me that you will not deal falsely</span><span class="c4">. After having been deceived by Abraham once, Abimelech does not trust Abraham completely. He does not know what might be on that man&rsquo;s mind.<br>It is quite interesting: it seems that Abraham was not any sort of stained-glass saint. He clearly did not make an impression of man who can be trusted and would always do what is right. <br>Abimelech needed an oath: a guarantee that is unbreakable because he sees how God acts.</span></p><p class="c2"><span>21:25: Before sealing the treaty, </span><span class="c0">Abraham</span><span>&nbsp;raises the contentious issue of ownership of </span><span class="c0">a well</span><span class="c4">. The covenant or treaty was designed to prevent conflict between the two parties. (ESV)</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c4">21:25: It seems that Beersheba is here being established as the border, the point where Israel ends and Philistia starts. Abraham will swear that he will not deal falsely with Abimelech, but only after the issue with the land division is settled. The gift of seven ewe lambs to Abimelech confirms Abraham&rsquo;s ownership of the well. <br>After Abimelech agrees with the well belonging to Abraham, there is no contention anymore, and Abraham is ready to swear that oath. Then Abimelech &ldquo;returned to the land of the Philistines&rdquo; (v. 32).<br>Because Beersheba will mark the southern boundary of Israel, this episode may signify the first claiming of the land and the making of the first border.</span></p><p class="c2"><span>21:31: The Hebrew words for &ldquo;</span><span class="c0">seven</span><span>&rdquo; (</span><span class="c0">sheba&lsquo;</span><span>) and &ldquo;oath&rdquo; (shebu&lsquo;ah) are similar, it could also mean &ldquo;</span><span class="c0">well of the oath</span><span class="c4">.&rdquo; Perhaps the name was chosen because it embraced both concepts. (ESV)</span></p><p class="c2"><span>21:31: The town of </span><span class="c0">Beersheba</span><span class="c4">, located in the northern Negeb, became famous as marking the southern boundary of Israel. (ESV)</span></p><p class="c2"><span>21:32: The use of the term &ldquo;</span><span class="c0">Philistines</span><span class="c4">&rdquo; here is generally taken to be anachronistic, since the name is normally associated with non-Canaanites from the Aegean region who inhabited southwest Canaan from about 1180 B.C. onward&mdash;nearly a thousand years after Abraham&rsquo;s time. (In 1 Samuel the Philistines are portrayed as the main opponents of the Israelites.) In light of this, the term may be used here and elsewhere to replace an earlier, obscure term; Genesis contains various examples of such modernizations. (ESV)</span></p><p class="c2"><span>21:33: </span><span class="c0">Everlasting God</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;(Hb. &rsquo;El &lsquo;Olam). &rsquo;El = God, followed &lsquo;Olam: the attribute &ldquo;of everlastingness&rdquo;. (ESV)</span></p><h3 class="c7" id="h.wxb07y3mjo6t"><span class="c11 c0">The Sacrifice of Isaac</span></h3><p class="c2"><span>22:1: </span><span class="c0">God tested Abraham</span><span>. Did He test Abraham because God needed more information about Abraham&rsquo;s obedience in different situations? Surely not. God </span><span class="c0">tested Abraham</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;for his own sake: to purify him, to teach him something, to let him see and understand.<br>God did not need that test. Abraham did.</span></p><p class="c2"><span>22:1: The genuineness of Abraham&rsquo;s obedience to God is </span><span class="c0">tested</span><span class="c4">. While it is not unknown for God to test individuals, testing must be clearly distinguished from tempting. God does not tempt anyone to do evil (Jas 1:13: &ldquo; God cannot be tempted with evil, and he himself tempts no one&rdquo;); he does, however, test the commitment of people (e.g., Ex. 15:25: &ldquo;What shall we drink?&rdquo;; 16:4: &ldquo;grumbled against Moses&rdquo;). (ESV)</span></p><p class="c2"><span>22:1: </span><span class="c0">Here I am</span><span class="c4">. Abraham responds with readiness to listen and obey. So far, God has been patient with him and kind to him. However, the words that came must have made Abraham&rsquo;s face turn pale.</span></p><p class="c2"><span>22:2: </span><span class="c0">Your son, your only son, whom you love</span><span class="c4">. Triple emphasis on the tender attitude Abraham had for his son emphasizes the essence of the test.</span></p><p class="c2"><span>22:2: </span><span class="c0">Your only son. </span><span>With the departure of Ishmael from Abraham&rsquo;s household, Isaac had become Abraham&rsquo;s </span><span class="c0">only son</span><span class="c4">. (ESV)</span></p><p class="c2"><span>22:2: </span><span class="c0">Of which I shall tell you</span><span class="c4">. This statement makes the command incomplete: Abraham will have to accomplish the immediate task at hand (take his son to Moriah and prepare everything needed for a burnt offering), but still be expecting further instructions. Abraham set off in an expectation of another word, knowing that he won&rsquo;t be left without guidance.</span></p><p class="c2"><span>22:2: </span><span class="c0">Moriah</span><span class="c4">. According to 2 Chron. 3:1, Solomon constructed the temple on Mount Moriah in Jerusalem. Also, &nbsp;It requires about two days to travel on foot from Beersheba to Jerusalem (v. 4: &ldquo;on the third day). (ESV)</span></p><p class="c2"><span>22:3: </span><span class="c0">Abraham </span><span class="c4">displays remarkable trust in God, especially when the death of Isaac would appear to contradict all that God had promised to Abraham.</span></p><p class="c2"><span>22:3: </span><span class="c0">Rose early in the morning</span><span class="c4">. The lack of any other comment Indicates Abraham&rsquo;s readiness to fulfill what God has just commanded. &nbsp;Heb 11:17 says that Abraham did it &ldquo;by faith&rdquo;, because &ldquo;He considered that God was able even to raise him from the dead&rdquo; (Heb 11:19).</span></p><p class="c2"><span>22:4: </span><span class="c0">On the third day</span><span class="c4">. For three days straight Abraham was confident that he will have to kill &ldquo;his son, his only son, whom he loves&rdquo;.</span></p><p class="c2"><span>22:4: </span><span class="c0">On the third day</span><span class="c4">. Elsewhere, two days also represents the time set aside to prepare for a special encounter with God on the third day (Ex 19:11: &ldquo;be ready for the third day. For on the third day gthe LORD will come down on Mount Sinai in the sight of all the people&rdquo;). Perhaps this sets the pattern for the significant &ldquo;third day&rdquo; (Mt 16:21, 1 Cor 15:4: &ldquo;be killed and raised on the third day&rdquo;). (ESV)</span></p><p class="c2"><span>22:5: </span><span class="c0">Stay here</span><span>. Abraham left them behind because he did not want them to see what was going to happen. He was absolutely ready to sacrifice his own son, if that is what his God wanted. <br></span><span class="c0">Will come again to you</span><span class="c4">. However, Abraham was also confident that both of them will return. This is why the author of Hebrews confidently says that Abraham thought &ldquo;God was able even to raise him from the dead&rdquo; (Heb 11:19).</span></p><p class="c2"><span>22:6: </span><span class="c0">Laid the wood on Isaac</span><span class="c4">. Isaac carrying the wood for his own sacrifice is a type of Christ carrying the cross for his own crucifixion.</span></p><p class="c2"><span>22:6: </span><span class="c0">He took the knife</span><span class="c4">. Abraham couldn&rsquo;t give the weapon to a person whom he was going to assault. It is quite unlikely that one would expect a person to willingly lay his life onto an altar.</span></p><p class="c2"><span>22:7: </span><span class="c0">Where is the lamb?</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;Isaac asking about the lamb indicates that the family was quite used to the ritual of the burned offering. It was something that Abraham has already done before.</span></p><p class="c2"><span>22:7: </span><span class="c0">Where is the lamb?</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;It is obvious that Abraham decided not to tell his son the whole story. The fact that Isaac will have to die on that mountain was completely unknown to him, just as it would have had been for a real lamb.</span></p><p class="c2"><span>22:8: </span><span class="c0">God will provide</span><span class="c4">. This is a key verse, for these very words become the name of the place in v. 14. <br>It is possible that Abraham was less than sincere with Isaac (for Abraham has already had a history of resorting to deception in difficult circumstances), but at the same time, those words may have been prophetic (Gen 20:7: &ldquo;he is a prophet&rdquo;; Jn 11:51: &ldquo;He did not say this of his own accord, but ... he prophesied&rdquo; -- saying that people may blurt out a prophecy without even knowing that God has put those words into their mouth).</span></p><p class="c2"><span>22:9: </span><span class="c0">God had told him</span><span class="c4">. There probably was an unreported episode where God showed Abraham some specific mountain.</span></p><p class="c2"><span>22:9: </span><span class="c0">Bound Isaac his son</span><span class="c4">. There probably has been some wrestling, where Abraham had overpowered his beloved Son, immobilized him, then bound him with ropes. This is why Abraham has not told him anything, and this is why he hasn&rsquo;t given Isaas the knife: because Isaac wouldn&rsquo;t be willing to die. He would defend his life.<br>Just imagine the feelings of a father: three days thinking about it on the way, then assaulting the one you love, your only son, then binding him. All that violence, and what&rsquo;s ahead: murdering Isaac with his father&rsquo;s hand.</span></p><p class="c2"><span>22:9: (</span><span class="c1">future trust</span><span class="c4">) How amazing must have been the faith of that person who could do all that, no hesitation, having heard just one word from his God! <br>After such an episode, it will be very easy for Abraham to obey God in any other matter. If you once trusted God with something dear, in a fearful labor&hellip; everything else is a breeze. You just trust. Period.</span></p><p class="c2"><span>22:10: </span><span class="c0">&#1040;&#1074;&#1088;&#1072;&#1072;&#1084; &#1074;&#1079;&#1103;&#1083; &#1053;&#1086;&#1078;</span><span class="c4">, &#1087;&#1086;&#1090;&#1086;&#1084;&#1091; &#1095;&#1090;&#1086; &#1073;&#1099;&#1083; &#1091;&#1074;&#1077;&#1088;&#1077;&#1085;, &#1095;&#1090;&#1086; &#1041;&#1086;&#1075; &#1095;&#1090;&#1086;-&#1085;&#1080;&#1073;&#1091;&#1076;&#1100; &#1087;&#1088;&#1080;&#1076;&#1091;&#1084;&#1072;&#1077;&#1090;. &#1057;&#1090;&#1080;&#1093; 8: &ldquo;&#1041;&#1086;&#1075; &#1091;&#1089;&#1084;&#1086;&#1090;&#1088;&#1080;&#1090;&rdquo;.

It&rsquo;s not that God was waiting until the very last moment, like in a Hollywood movie. Watching his own son cringe on an altar, Abraham had to overcome the next-to-last obstacle have the heart to obey God till the end. The reaching of the hand to take the knife indicates his final readiness. </span></p><p class="c2"><span>22:12: </span><span class="c0">Do not &hellip; now I know that you fear God.</span><span>&nbsp;Difficult. Sounds like God needed information? Or perhaps, another reason for the test was to show </span><span class="c3">the angels</span><span>&nbsp;that He has a faithful servant on earth? Far-fetched? See 1 Cor 4:9: &ldquo;we have become a spectacle to the world, to angels, and to men&rdquo;.<br>However, in the same verse, the angels says &ldquo;you have not withheld your son ... </span><span class="c0">from me</span><span class="c4">&rdquo;, clearly speaking for God.<br>So it seems. God is saying, &ldquo;now I know&rdquo;. Not sure what so say about it.</span></p><p class="c2"><span>22:12: </span><span class="c0">You have not withheld your son, your only son, from me</span><span class="c4">. This was the fork in the road: will Abraham choose to obey God because he loved his son so much, or would he be ready to give up what he cherished? We call it parental love, caring love, but what was tested here was the selfish part of that love: the one that wouldn&rsquo;t give up, even when God, just and righteous and infinitely wise, requires it.</span></p><p class="c2"><span>22:12: </span><span class="c0">Now I know</span><span class="c4">. &nbsp;While Abraham&rsquo;s faith was earlier the means by which God counted him as righteous (15:6), that faith is now &ldquo;active along with his works,&rdquo; and the faith is &ldquo;completed by his works&rdquo; (Jas 2:21&ndash;23), so that his faith resulted in obedience, which is its expected outcome. (ESV)</span></p><p class="c2"><span>22:12: (</span><span class="c1">faith vs selfishness</span><span class="c4">) The way of faith would trust God to do the right thing even when it looks ridiculous. God, You want to take what I love from me? I trust you. Please take. I believe that what You do it best.<br>The way of selfishness would choose your own way: I love my son, I cannot give him up. This does not make sense: murdering my son! No way, I won&rsquo;t do it. It&rsquo;s cruel, and it makes no sense.<br>Notice how natural it would be to resort to reasoning about love and logic! Faithlessness may cover itself up with common sense and lofty matters. This is why the Bibe says &ldquo;lean not on your own understanding&rdquo; (Prov 3:5). Because God&rsquo;s ways sometimes may make no sense to us at all.</span></p><p class="c2"><span>22:12: James 2:21&ndash;22 says Abraham was &ldquo;justified by works&rdquo; and that his &ldquo;faith was completed by his works&rdquo;. </span><span class="c3">Completed</span><span class="c4">, i.e., brought to its full and proper expression. This shows that &ldquo;justified&rdquo; in Jas&nbsp;2:21 probably has the sense &ldquo;shown to be righteous,&rdquo; rather than the sense &ldquo;counted righteous&rdquo; often found in Paul&rsquo;s writings. (ESV)</span></p><p class="c2"><span>22:12: (</span><span class="c0">I </span><span>know</span><span class="c0">, </span><span>you fear</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;God; </span><span>did not withhold</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;from me</span><span class="c4">). It is the angel (lit. messenger) speaking (v.11: &ldquo;the messenger of the Lord), and the angel said that &ldquo;I&rdquo; know that you fear &ldquo;God&rdquo;. Who knows, the angel? But further: you did not withhold your son &ldquo;from me&rdquo;. Could Abraham withhold his son from the angel? <br>This means that the messenger is God Himself, and yet he speaks about God in third person. Then, it means that me messenger is both God and of God; which means, the messenger is Jesus Christ, the Son, speaking for God, about the Father.

We can only wonder about Isaac from the point when he has seen his father change his mind about killing him. How they talked. How Abraham undid the knots. How they went back together. How they lived after such a moment.<br>In two chapters, Abraham will send his servant to a foreign country to find a wife for his son. There was no break in their relationship. God has somehow healed this rift.</span></p><p class="c2"><span>22:14: </span><span class="c0">The Lord will provide</span><span class="c4">. &ldquo;Yahweh-Yireh&rdquo; (Hb) The verb literally means to see, or, to see to a thing, and the sense of the proverb plainly is that in man&#39;s necessity God will Himself see to it, and provide due help and deliverance. (Ellicott&rsquo;s Commentary)</span></p><p class="c2"><span>22:13-14: </span><span class="c0">Instead of his son. The Lord will provide.</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;There probably is a deeper, much deeper meaning to the story than just the Lord playing with Abraham&rsquo;s obedience to teach him a lesson.<br>Remember when David sinned with Bathsheba, and his son died in 2 Sam 12? David has committed a sin, and he had to lose something dear to him. That was his lesson: the Lord&rsquo;s discipline, with which He purifies us. His son had to die, because of justice.<br>In this story, did Abraham sin? Yes. May it be that Isaac was meant by God&rsquo;s justice to be taken from him? Sure. Then Isaac has already been sealed for death in a way. It could only be averted if God Himself provided a substitution: a ram, in this case. So the ram has died for Isaac. All of this because of Abraham&rsquo;s faith.<br>And surely Isaac and the ram is a type of mankind and Christ: mankind had to die because of sin (Isaac, sin), this punishment was only averted because of a substitutionary death of Jesus (ram), and all of this is only possible because of faith (Abraham, &ldquo;the father of all who believe&rdquo; (Rom 4:16)).</span></p><p class="c2"><span>22:14: </span><span class="c0">The Lord will provide</span><span class="c4">. This notable episode establishes the principle of a substitutionary sacrifice: a death of a human being is required for sin (mankind), but the Lord Himself provides a substitution (Jesus).</span></p><p class="c2"><span>22:14: </span><span class="c0">The Lord will provide</span><span>. God would provide the sacrifice necessary to atone for sin. </span><span class="c0">On the mount of the LORD</span><span class="c4">. The Temple mount. (ESV)</span></p><p class="c2"><span>22:16: </span><span class="c0">By myself I have sworn</span><span class="c4">. Rom 6:13: &ldquo;since he had no one greater by whom to swear, he swore by himself&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span>22:17:</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;As the stars of heaven ..., as the sand that is on the seashore</span><span class="c4">. The test was great, but the blessing is even greater. An overflowing one. This is how God deals with those who love Him.</span></p><p class="c2"><span>22:17: </span><span class="c0">Multiply your offspring</span><span>&nbsp;(lit. seed, Hb. </span><span class="c3">zaraka</span><span>). Speaks about the nation, Israel. </span><span class="c0">Your offspring</span><span>&nbsp;(lit. seed, Hb. </span><span class="c3">zaraka</span><span>)</span><span class="c0">.</span><span>&nbsp;May still refer to the nation of Israel, who then </span><span class="c0">overcomes his enemies</span><span>&nbsp;and mediates blessings </span><span class="c0">to all the nations of the earth</span><span>, because Jesus Christ is born in them. Or may refer to a single seed, an offspring, Who is a single descendant who </span><span class="c0">overcomes His enemies</span><span>&nbsp;and mediates blessings </span><span class="c0">to all the nations</span><span class="c4">. Either way, it points to Christ.</span></p><p class="c2"><span>22:17: Because Genesis as a whole is interested in tracing a single unique line of offspring that will eventually bring forth a special King who will rule over the Gentiles, the second half of the promise is taken to refer to a single </span><span class="c0">descendant</span><span>&nbsp;who will </span><span class="c0">overcome his enemies</span><span>&nbsp;and mediate blessing </span><span class="c0">to all the nations</span><span>&nbsp;of the earth. This is why Paul can insist on one offspring, who is &ldquo;Christ&rdquo; (Gal 3:16: &ldquo;the promises were made to Abraham and to his offspring ... referring to one &hellip;, who is Christ.&rdquo;).</span></p><h3 class="c7" id="h.ejdb688bzv84"><span class="c11 c0">Sarah&#39;s Death and Burial</span></h3><p class="c2"><span>23:2: </span><span class="c0">Mourn and weep</span><span class="c4">. He loved her dearly.</span></p><p class="c2"><span>23:3: </span><span class="c0">To the Hittites</span><span class="c4">. Presumably Abraham addressed the leaders of the Hittites who were assembled at the gate of Hebron. The city gate was commonly the location where public decisions were formally made and transactions between individuals were ratified. (ESV)</span></p><p class="c2"><span>23:6: </span><span class="c0">Prince of God</span><span class="c4">. Abraham obviously had a reputation of one living under God&rsquo;s protection and favor.</span></p><p class="c2"><span>23:6: </span><span class="c0">Hear us, my lord; you are a prince of God</span><span>. Hb &ldquo;schemaenu adoni, attah elohim nesi&rdquo;. </span><span class="c0">Prince of God</span><span class="c4">, lit. God&rsquo;s king, God&rsquo;s chosen one. Prince, leader, chief, captain, ruler.</span></p><p class="c2"><span>23:7: </span><span class="c0">Bowed</span><span class="c4">. God&rsquo;s king respectfully bowing to the people is remarkable.</span></p><p class="c2"><span>23:8: </span><span class="c0">Entreat for me</span><span class="c4">. Probably means that Abraham did not know him well; otherwise, Abraham would have spoken to Ephron himself. Ephron is actually present (v.10).</span></p><p class="c2"><span>23:8: </span><span class="c0">Entreat for me</span><span class="c4">. Ephron is present when these discussions take place at the city gate (v. 10), Abraham first seeks permission from the Hittite population as a whole. This may have been necessary either because Abraham himself was not a Hittite or because the transfer of property from one individual to another required the involvement of a third party. (ESV)</span></p><p class="c2"><span>23:9: </span><span class="c0">For the full price</span><span class="c4">. In v.6 the implication probably was that Abraham could take anything for free. In v.&nbsp;11 that&rsquo;s what Ephron actually offers: take it. For free. It&rsquo;s yours.</span></p><p class="c2"><span>23:10: </span><span class="c0">The Gate</span><span class="c4">. Where the rulers gathered and where decisions were made.</span></p><p class="c2"><span>23:12: </span><span class="c0">Bowed dows before the people</span><span class="c4">. Abraham is held in great esteem, which can be seen by his title (Elohim nesi, God&rsquo;s prince), and by the fact that Ephron offers his property for free.</span></p><p class="c2"><span>23:15: </span><span class="c0">Four hundred</span><span class="c4">. Since the weight of a shekel could vary, it is impossible to be certain about the precise value of the field and cave. It is often suggested, on the basis of comparisons with 1 Kings 16:24 and Jer. 32:9, that this was a high price to pay, but one cannot be sure. &nbsp;(ESV)</span></p><p class="c2"><span>23:17: </span><span class="c0">Land</span><span class="c4">. By acquiring this plot of land, Abraham not only establishes future rights to it for his family but puts down a marker that his descendants are to be associated with the land of Canaan, as God had already promised (ESV)</span></p><p class="c2"><span>23:18: </span><span class="c0">In the presence of the Hittites, before all</span><span class="c4">. The author has dedicated the whole chapter to an episode where a certain field was legally transferred to Abraham in the presence of many people. This must have been some important patch of land for the author to pay so much attention to it. Perhaps, that is because it is the first patch of land that he legally obtains; the first step of how God&rsquo;s promise begins to get fulfilled? Or was the whole episode was probably penned to emphasize the legality of Israel&rsquo;s possession of that land.</span></p><p class="c2"><span>23:19: According to tradition, </span><span class="c0">the cave of Machpelah</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;is located beneath the present Mosque of Abraham in Hebron. (ESV)</span></p><p class="c2"><span>23:20: </span><span class="c0">Made over to Abraham as a property</span><span>. Abraham&rsquo;s purchase of the field and cave meant that his descendants would own this land in perpetuity. Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, Rebekah, and Leah would later be laid to rest in this cave. (ESV)</span></p><h3 class="c7" id="h.s2g6jp5f1jv7"><span class="c11 c0">Isaac and Rebekah</span></h3><p class="c2"><span>24: (</span><span class="c1">overview</span><span class="c4">) In this story, the author highlights how God controls events so that, after a long journey from Canaan to northern Mesopotamia, Abraham&rsquo;s servant is guided to Rebekah. Then, like Abraham, Rebekah must leave her family and country in an act of faith in order to journey to Canaan and marry Isaac, whom she has never met. Genesis&rsquo;s first audience would marvel at how God orchestrated the servant&rsquo;s faithfulness, Rebekah&rsquo;s positive response, and some unlikely events (e.g., v. 15) to bring about the marriage; they would be better able to see their very existence as the result of God&rsquo;s guiding hand. (ESV)</span></p><p class="c2"><span>24:2: Abraham entrusts the important task of finding a wife for Isaac to his most reliable </span><span class="c0">servant</span><span class="c4">. (ESV)</span></p><p class="c2"><span>24:2: Likely, the </span><span class="c0">servant</span><span class="c4">&rsquo;s name was Eliezer (Gen 15:2)</span></p><p class="c2"><span>24:3: </span><span class="c0">Not take a wife of the Canaanites</span><span class="c4">. Jewish readers who know the history of Israel would immediately recognize that marrying a pagan woman would jeopardize Isaac&rsquo;s faith. In v. 1, Abraham is already portrayed as a person who had a special relationship with God (&ldquo;the LORD had blessed Abraham in all things&rdquo;), and Isaac also seems to be a worshipper of God (v. 63: &ldquo;to meditate&rdquo;).</span></p><p class="c2"><span>24:3: </span><span class="c0">Canaanites</span><span class="c4">. Abraham is deeply concerned that Isaac should not marry a Canaanite; he fears that this will draw him away from worshiping the Lord. Canaanites are frequently portrayed as being wicked in Genesis. (ESV)</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c4">24:4: The journey was approximately 900 km along ancient routes and would have taken Abraham&rsquo;s servant approximately 21 days to travel. (ESV)</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c4">24:4: Later, Jacob would make this same journey as he fled from his brother Esau. He will get wives from the same region (29:1&ndash;28). (ESV)</span></p><p class="c2"><span>24:4: In spite of having left Haran in northern Mesopotamia almost a hundred years earlier, Abraham refers to it as </span><span class="c0">my country</span><span class="c4">. (ESV)</span></p><p class="c2"><span>24:6: </span><span class="c0">Do not take my son back there</span><span class="c4">. Isaac&rsquo;s future is to be in Canaan, for God has promised this land to Abraham&rsquo;s descendants. (ESV)</span></p><p class="c2"><span>24:9: </span><span class="c0">Under the thigh</span><span class="c4">. By undertaking this action, the servant binds himself to obey Abraham&rsquo;s request. (ESV)</span></p><p class="c2"><span>24:10: </span><span class="c0">Nahor</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;is also the name of Terah&rsquo;s father (Gen 11:25) and Abraham&rsquo;s brother (Gen 11:26&ndash;27; 22:20). The use of the same name for both a city and a person is not unusual; settlements are sometimes named after people, and people are sometimes named after places. (ESV)</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c4">24:14: The servant (like Abraham) has faith in the Lord and prays for guidance. The specific request is not the ordinary way to ask for guidance: the servant might better have asked for wisdom to discern the best wife for Isaac rather than to probe into what God had providentially appointed. Nevertheless, God graciously honors the request (cf. Gideon&rsquo;s fleece, Judg. 6:36&ndash;40) as his means of directing events. (ESV)</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c4">24:14: The conditions set by the servant reveal that he is seeking a wife who has a generous and caring disposition. (ESV)</span></p><p class="c2"><span>24:17: Eliezer did not appear as a helpless, weary chap begging for a drink. And Rebecca, the daughter of Bethuel, the ruler of Aram Naharaim, was a young woman of nobility, not a poor servant girl accustomed to lugging water from wells. But this is precisely where Eliezer was able to get a glimpse of the righteous Rebecca. (</span><span class="c1 c6"><a class="c8" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.chabad.org/theJewishWoman/article_cdo/aid/763991/jewish/Rebecca-and-the-Camel-Test.htm&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1582399365231000">Internet</a></span><span class="c4">)</span></p><p class="c2"><span>24:19: </span><span class="c0">I will draw water for your camels</span><span>. Camels need watered about every ten days. They can lose up to 40% of their body weight in water and fat before they feel the effects of the desert&rsquo;s dry environment. A camel who has not drunk water in ten days can consume 150 liters of water in less than half an hour! <br>Now let&rsquo;s look at what Abraham&rsquo;s servant asked as a sign for Isaac&rsquo;s wife, and what the teenage girl was willing to do: she volunteered to tote more than a ton and a half of water from the spring to take care of the caravan and its camels. How many teenagers do you know that would volunteer that kind of work effort today?

(ESV)</span></p><p class="c2"><span>24:29: </span><span class="c0">Rebekah&rsquo;s brother Laban</span><span class="c4">. While Laban&rsquo;s father Bethuel is still alive (cf. v. 50), his lack of involvement in the narrative suggests that he may well be incapacitated, possibly through old age. (ESV)</span></p><p class="c2"><span>24:50: </span><span class="c0">The thing has come from the LORD</span><span class="c4">. Rebekah&rsquo;s brother and father acknowledge that the providential nature of all that has taken place convincingly indicates that Rebekah should become Isaac&rsquo;s wife. This is clearly God&rsquo;s will. (ESV)</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c4">24:53: The gifts confirm what the servant has earlier said about Abraham&rsquo;s wealth. (ESV)</span></p><p class="c2"><span>24:63: </span><span class="c0">Isaac went out to meditate</span><span class="c4">. This is another divinely directed event, which allows for Isaac to be the first person to meet Rebekah when they arrive at Isaac&rsquo;s homeland.

Like Hagar, she has the status of a &ldquo;concubine&rdquo;. See 1 Chron. 1:32: &ldquo;his concubine&rdquo;. No indication is given as to when this relationship was established; it possibly existed before the death of Sarah. Reflecting the culture of the ancient Near East, it was not unknown for men to take &ldquo;second&rdquo; wives, but this was usually an action of those who were wealthy. The precise status of Keturah is unknown; she may have been a maidservant of Sarah. (ESV)</span></p><p class="c2"><span>25:2: </span><span class="c0">Midian</span><span>.

The desire to make a peaceful covenant arises from a change of heart by Abimelech, who now acknowledges the Lord&rsquo;s presence with Isaac. <br>The covenant seems to become a covenant between nations.</span></p><p class="c2"><span>26:29: </span><span class="c0">You are now the blessed of the Lord</span><span class="c4">.

It cannot refer to adultery, because death was the penalty for that. <br>What kind of indecency, then, would lead to the certificate of dismissal?

The focus of that passage is not the question of whether or not divorce is permitted: it does not provide for divorce, much less command it. It shows how improper divorce leads to adultery, which results in defilement. A woman is defiled because of the adultery brought about by her second marriage. Moses is saying, then, that the divorce for indecency or promiscuity creates an adulterous situation.

That curse does not preclude Jesus&#39; right to kingship because He is not a natural son of Joseph, who was in Jeconiah&#39;s line. Jesus&#39; legal descent from David came through Jeconiah to Joseph, but His blood descent, and </span><span class="c3">His human right to rule</span><span>, came through Mary, who was not in Jeconiah&#39;s lineage.

While Luke&#39;s intent is to trace Jesus&#39; actual royal blood ancestry through His mother, thereby establishing his racial lineage from David, and from Adam.

There was defeat, conquest, exile, and the destruction of Jerusalem and its temple. </span><span class="c0">From the deportation to Babylon to the time of Christ</span><span>&nbsp;was Israel&#39;s Dark Age: a period of captivity, exile, frustration and of marking time. (MacArthur)</span></p><p class="c2"><span>1:18: </span><span class="c0">Birth</span><span>&nbsp;(Gk. </span><span class="c3">genesis</span><span class="c4">) is from the same Greek root as &quot;genealogy&quot; in v. 1, indicating that Matthew is here giving a parallel account on Jesus&#39; ancestry: this time, from His Father&#39;s side. vv. 1-17 established Jesus&#39; human origin; the following verses show HIs divine origin. (MacArthur)</span></p><p class="c2"><span>1:18: The incarnation of </span><span class="c0">Jesus Christ</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;is the central fact of Christianity. The whole superstructure of Christian theology is built on it. The essence and the power of the gospel is that God became man and that, by being both wholly God and wholly man, He was able to reconcile men to God. Apart from Jesus&#39; being both human and divine, there is no gospel. Were He no more than just a human prophet, He could not have conquered sin or death or satan; He could not have saved the world. It is surely no accident, therefore, that the beginning of the gospel is devoted to establishing both the regal humanity and the deity of Jesus Christ. (MacArthur) </span></p><p class="c2"><span>1:18: Some argued that the men who wrote the NT could have simply picked up on the many virgin </span><span class="c0">birth</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;legends that were common in the ancient world. But the immoral and repulsive character of those stories cannot be compared to the gospel accounts: such stories are satan&#39;s vile counterfeits of God&#39;s pure truth. (MacArthur)</span></p><p class="c2"><span>1:18: It is possible that both Joseph and Mary were quite young when they were </span><span class="c0">betrothed</span><span class="c4">. Girls were often betrothed as young as 12 or 13, and boys when they were several years older than that. The marriage was almost always arranged by the families of the bride and groom, often without consulting them. A betrothal was more than an engagement in the modern sense: the contract was considered binding as soon as it was made, and the man and woman were considered legally married, even though the marriage and consummation often did not occur until as much as a year later. The betrothal period served as a time of probation and testing of fidelity, when the bride and groom usually had little, if any, social contact with each other. (MacArthur)</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c4">1:18: The virgin birth should not have surprised those Jews who knew and believed the OT. Because of a misinterpretation of the phrase &quot;A woman encircles a man&quot; in jer 31:22, many rabbis believed the Messiah would have an unusual birth. They said, &quot;Messiah is to have no earthly father&quot;. (MacArthur)</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c4">1:18: A skeptic who denied the virgin birth once asked a Christian: &quot;If I told you that child over there was born without a human father, would you believe me?&quot; The believer replied: &quot;Yes, if he lived as Jesus lived&quot;. The greatest outward evidence of Jesus&#39; supernatural birth and deity is His life. (MacArthur)</span></p><p class="c2"><span>1:19: According to the Law, a woman who committed adultery could be stoned (Dt 22:23-24). It would&#39;ve been a great </span><span class="c0">shame</span><span>&nbsp;for her anyway. Wounded though he felt, Joseph decided to </span><span class="c0">divorce her quietly</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;for her sake: i.e. not bringing unnecessary shame on her. He had no option of giving her a second chance, even if he wanted to (IVP).</span></p><p class="c2"><span>1:19: </span><span class="c0">Joseph</span><span>&nbsp;had a double problem. Because of his </span><span class="c0">righteous</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;moral standards, Joseph knew that he should not go through with the marriage because of Mary&#39;s pregnancy, justly assuming that she had had relations with another man. But also, because of his righteous love and kindness, he could not bear the thought of shaming her publicly (a common practice of his day in regard to such an offense), much less demanding her death, as provided by the law (Dt 22:23-24). His concern was not for his own shame but for Mary&#39;s. (MacArthur)</span></p><p class="c2"><span>1:20: Jesus&#39; </span><span class="c0">conception by the Holy Spirit</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;is a great mystery. We could no more fathom such a thing than we can fathom the blending of the divine and human, like God&#39;s creating the universe from nothing, His being one God in three persons, or His giving an entirely new spiritual nature to those who trust in His Son. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c2"><span>1:21: The significance of this name is clear: &quot;</span><span class="c0">Jesus</span><span class="c4">&quot; is a form of the Hebrew Joshua, Jeshua, Jehoshua, the basic meaning of which is &quot;Yahweh will save&quot;. By His own work He would save His people from their sins. (MacArthur)</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c4">1:22: This phrase gives a simple, straightforward definition of biblical inspiration as the Word of the Lord coming through human instruments. God does the saying. (MacArthur)</span></p><p class="c2"><span>1:23: Matthew did not give the term </span><span class="c3">alma</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;a Christian &quot;twist&quot;, but used it with the same meaning with which all Jews of that time used it. See Is 7:14 and note. (MacArthur)</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c4">1:23: One title represents His office; the other &mdash; His nature. Understanding of such things will have to await heaven when we will &quot;know fully&quot; (1 Cor 13:12). (MacArthur)</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c4">1:24: When God reveals the truth to Joseph, he immediately believes and obeys God&#39;s will, unbelievable as the truth would seem. Joseph would remain an object of shame because he got his wife pregnant before the wedding. He chose to embrace shame (IVP).</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c4">1:24: We can imagine how great his feelings of amazement, relief, and gratitude must have been. Not only would he be able to take his beloved Mary as his wife with honor and righteousness, but he would be ien care of God&#39;s own Son while He was growing up. (MacArthur)</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c4">1:25: The implication here is that normal marital relations began after that time. The fact that Jesus&#39; brothers and sisters are spoken of numerous times in the gospels (Mt 12:46: &quot;his mother and his brothers stood outside&quot;; Mt 13:55-56 and Mk 6:3: &quot;And are not his brothers James and Joseph and Simon and Judas? And are not all his sisters with us?&quot;; Jn 7:5: &quot;For not even his brothers believed in him.&quot;; etc) prove that Mary did not remain a virgin perpetually, as some claim.

The homage of the </span><span class="c0">magi</span><span class="c4">: powerful oriental kingmakers from Persia who traveled a great distance to recognize and honor a King. And a negative testimony of Herod&#39;s hatred to a child. (MacArthur) </span></p><p class="c2"><span>2:1: </span><span class="c0">Magi</span><span class="c4">: priestly astrologers.

During the Middle Ages legend developed that they were kings, 3 in number, and that their names were Casper, Balthazar, and Melchior. Because they were though to represent the three sons of Noah, one of them is often pictured as an Ethiopian (black). A XII century bishop of Cologne even claimed to have found their skulls. (MacArthur)</span></p><p class="c2"><span>2:1: The </span><span class="c0">magi</span><span>&nbsp;(Gk. </span><span class="c3">magoi</span><span>)</span><span>&nbsp;were primarily known as the priestly-political class of the Parthians, who lived to the east of Palestine. They first appear in history in 7 B.C. as a tribe within the Median nation. Shemites. Soon came to be associated solely with the hereditary priesthood within that tribe. The magi became skilled in astronomy and astrology (which, in that day, were closely associated) and had a sacrificial system that somewhat resembled the one in the OT. They were involved in various occult practices, including sorcery, and were especially noted for their ability to interpret dreams. It is from their name that our words &quot;magic&quot; and &quot;magician&quot; are derived. <br>A principle element of magian worship was fire: on their primary altar burned a perpetual flame, which they claimed descended from heaven. The magi were monotheistic, believing in the existence of only one god. Because of their monotheism, it was easy for them to adapt to the teaching of Zoroaster, who believed in the single god. <br>Because of their combined knowledge of science, agriculture, mathematics, history, and the occult, their religious and political influence continued to grow until they became the most prominent and powerful group of advisors in the Medo-Persian empire. It was not strange, therefore, that they often were referred to a &quot;wise men&quot;. Historians tell us that no Persian was ever able to become king without mastering the scientific and religious disciplines of the magi and then beging approved and crowned by them. <br>From Daniel, we learn that they were among the highest-ranking officials in Babylon, when he was assigned a chief over them (Dan 2:24,48). It was a chief of the Babylonian magi that was with Nebuchadnezzar when he attacked and conquered Judah (Jer 39:3).<br>The </span><span class="c0">magic from the east</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;(Gk. anatolon, from anatello; literally: a rising of light, i.e. Dawn; by implication, east) were of a completely different sort. They surely had been strongly influenced by Judaism, probably God-fearing Gentiles. Despite their paganism, quasi-science, and superstition, they recognized God&#39;s voice when He spoke. They immediately recognized God&#39;s light when it shone on them. They had genuinely seeking hearts, hearts that the Lord promises will never fail to find Him (Jer 29:13).<br>(MacArthur) </span></p><p class="c2"><span>2:2: </span><span class="c0">saying</span><span>&nbsp;in its Greek form suggests that they went around the city questioning whomever they met. Because they, as foreigners, knew of the monumental birth, they apparently assumed that anyone in Judea would know of this special baby&#39;s whereabouts. They must have been more than a little shocked to discover that no one seemed to know what they were talking about.<br>During that time there was widespread expectation of the coming of a great king, a great deliverer. The Roman historian Suetonius, speaking of the time around the birth of Christ, wrote, &quot;There had spread over all the Orient an old and established belief that it was fated at that time for men coming from Judea to rule the world.&quot; Another Roman historian, Tacitus, wrote that &quot;there was a firm persuasion that at this very time the east was to grow powerful and rulers coming from Judea were to acquire a universal empire&quot;. The Jewish historian Josephus reports that at about the time of Christ&#39;s birth the Jews believed that one from their country would soon become ruler of the habitable earth.<br>(MacArthur)</span></p><p class="c2"><span>2:2: These wise men came from the rising of the light (east in v. 1, Gk. &quot;rising of the light&quot;), following a light (a </span><span class="c0">star</span><span class="c4">). That is, from light to light.</span></p><p class="c2"><span>2:2: Both the Hebrew and the Greek words for </span><span class="c0">star</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;(Gk. aster) were also used figuratively to represent any great brilliance or radiance. </span></p><p class="c2"><span>2:2: The guidance of the </span><span class="c0">star</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;was not very precise, for they had to ask around. Later, the star pinpointed the location. It is also possible that it disappeared, reappearing only after the magi were told of the prophesied birthplace of the Messiah (vv. 5&ndash;6).</span></p><p class="c2"><span>2:3: </span><span class="c0">Herod</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;was now some 70 years old. (MacArthur)</span></p><p class="c2"><span>2:3: </span><span class="c0">Herod</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;reigned over Palestine from 37BC to 4BC. He was known for killing his potential rivals. He surely wanted to kill this &quot;king of the Jews&quot; as well (John Strohman)</span></p><p class="c2"><span>2:3: </span><span class="c0">Herod</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;was an Edomite, not a Jew, and had no legitimate claim to be the Jew&#39;s king. He was a ururper to the throne on which he say only by virtue of Rome, who herself ruled Judah only by the &quot;right&quot; of military force. Herod therefore feared and hated even the suggestion of a rival claimant. (MacArthur)</span></p><p class="c2"><span>2:3: </span><span class="c0">Herod</span><span>&nbsp;the Great (one of the several Herods in the NT) was a clever and capable warrior, orator, and diplomat. In 40 B.C. he was appointed by Rome to be king of the Jews. He invaded Palestine the next year and, after several years of fighting, drove out the Parthians and established his kingdom. <br>Being an Edomite, he married Mariamne, heiress to the Jewish Hasmonean house, in order to make himself more acceptable to the Jews he now ruled. <br>In times of severe economic hardship, </span><span class="c0">Herod</span><span>&nbsp;gave back some tax money collected from the people. During the great famine of 25 B.C., he melted down various gold objects in the palace to buy food for the poor. He built many entertainment places. He revived Samaria, embellished several cities. He built the remarkable and almost impregnable fortress of Masada, and in 19 B.C. he began the reconstruction of the Temple in Jerusalem. <br>But </span><span class="c0">Herod</span><span>&nbsp;was also cruel and merciless. He was incredibly jealous, suspicious, and afraid for his position and power. Fearing his potential thread, he had the high priest Aristobulus (Mariamne&#39;s brother) drowned, after which he provided a magnificent funeral where he pretended to weep. He then had Mariamne herself killed, and then her mother and two of his own sons. Five days before his death (about a year after Jesus was born) he had his third son executed. Because he knew no one would mourn him, he has arrested the most distinguished citizens of Jerusalem and gave orders for those prisoners to be executed the moment he died &mdash; in order to guarantee that there would be mourning in Jerusalem; but it was not carried out. (MacArthur). <br></span><span class="c0">Herod</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;died in Jericho, after an excruciatingly painful, putrefying illness of uncertain cause, known to posterity as &quot;Herod&#39;s Evil&quot;. Josephus states that the pain of his illness led Herod to attempt suicide by stabbing. (Wikipedia) <br>Josephus reports that Herod &quot;died of this, ulcerated entrails, putrified and maggot-filled organs, constant convulsions, foul breath, and neither physicians nor warm baths led to recovery&quot;. (MacArthur)<br>Josephus also lists several major features of the disease that caused his death - among them, intense itching, painful intestinal problems, breathlessness, convulsions in every limb, and gangrene of the genitalia. (Internet)</span></p><p class="c2"><span>2:3: The response of </span><span class="c0">Herod</span><span>&nbsp;was exactly the opposite of that of the magi: they rejoiced, but he </span><span class="c0">was troubled</span><span>. Even after driving out the Parthians, he had to continue fighting the bands of Jewish zealots who wanted the freedom of their country. Any mention of another king of the Jews sent him into a frenzy of paranoid fear and anger. Because the magi themselves were probably Parthians, and because of their wealth, prestige, and power, their appearance from the east portended a renewed political thread from the east.<br>That </span><span class="c0">all Jesusalem with him</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;was also troubled may indicate that they too viewed the magi as the precursors of another conquest by the Parthians, who had sent this forward body ahead to discover and perhaps even crown some new king that would rule Palestine in Parthia&#39;s behalf. Since the magi had long been known as much for their politics as for their religion, their worship would not have been seen as purely religious.<br>It is more likely that the public concern was actually about Herod&#39;s reaction to the appearance of the magi: by bitter experience they knew that Herod&#39;s agitation usually meant maniacal bloodsched: he did not bother to identify his enemies carefully, and anyone even suspected of plotting against him was in considerable danger. The people&#39;s fear for their own safety was well founded. In v. 16, we will see how his anger is vented against Bethlehem.<br>(MacArthur)</span></p><p class="c2"><span>2:4: By NT times, the high</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;priests</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;had become little more than a group of corrupt, religiously oriented politicians, subject to favoritism and even purchase. High priests were appointed and removed at the whim of various rulers. The ones who had been removed usually kept the title, as well as considerable prestige and power (Lk 3:2: &quot;during the high priesthood of Ananias and Caiaphas&quot;, mentions two high priests). (MacArthur)</span></p><p class="c2"><span>2:4: The </span><span class="c0">scribes</span><span class="c4">, mostly Pharisees, often referred to as lawyers, were authorities on Jewish law, scriptural and traditional; the key scholars of religious Judaism. They were conservative theologically, held a literalistic view of Scripture, and were generally legalistic and strict in regard to both ceremonial and moral law. Those of the Scribes who were Sadducees were liberal.</span></p><p class="c2"><span>2:4: Herod took the matter seriously and </span><span class="c0">assembled</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span class="c0">the chief priests</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;in order to help the magi find the Christ. The magi did not depart, but awaited for Herod&#39;s priests to consult the priests. In v. 8, Herod sends the magi to Bethlehem, according to the direction given to him by the priests.</span></p><p class="c2"><span>2:4: </span><span class="c0">Herod</span><span>&nbsp;called all of them together, constantly asking (the imperfect tense of </span><span class="c0">inquire</span><span class="c4">). (MacArthur)</span></p><p class="c2"><span>2:4: Obviously Herod connected the King of the Jews with the Messiah, the </span><span class="c0">Christ</span><span class="c4">, for he knew Jewish beliefs and customs rather well. (MacArthur)</span></p><p class="c2"><span>2:4: Contrary to what many, perhaps most, unbelieving Jews today think, those ancient teachers of Israel knew that the coming Messiah, </span><span class="c0">the Christ</span><span class="c4">, would be more than a godly attitude or the personified perfection of the Jewish Kingdom. The Messiah would be a real man born among men, sent to rule men. The ones that had more than enough knowledge to recognize HIm when He came and to know that they, like the magi, should worship Him, did not believe, and became His supreme enemies. (MacArthur)</span></p><p class="c2"><span>2:4: Wee see the three typical responses to Jesus Christ here. Some, like Herod, are immediately hateful. Others, like the priests, pay little attention to God and His way: they do not accept of obey what they know of God; eventually, of course, this second group inevitably joins the first, because indifference to God is simply hatred that is concealed and rejection that is delayed. Others, however, like the magi, accept the Lord when He comes to them. They may have little of His light initially, but because they know it is </span><span class="c3">His</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;light, they believe, obey, and worship. (MacArthur)</span></p><p class="c2"><span>2:6: </span><span class="c0">Bethlehem</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;was a small town. It used to be called &quot;Ephrath&quot; or &quot;Ephrathah&quot;, but its new name (given by Joshua) means &quot;house of bread&quot;. Here Jacob buried Rachel (Gen 35:19). Here Ruth met and married Boaz (Ruth 1:22, 2:4). Here, David grew up and tended sheep (1 Sam 17:12,15). By the time of Jesus&#39; birth, it had long been called &quot;the city of David&quot; (Lk 2:4,11). The prophet Micah specifically promised that the Messiah would come from this small village (Mic 5:2). (MacArthur)</span></p><p class="c2"><span>2:6: </span><span class="c0">shepherd</span><span>ing is typically understood as &quot;tender care&quot; by the people, but scriptural view is a strong, even stern, leader, a </span><span class="c0">Ruler</span><span class="c4">. It becomes clear that a sovereign dominance is meant in in the book of Revelation: &quot;with a rod of iron&quot; (Rev 12:5). (MacArthur)</span></p><p class="c2"><span>2:7: It was already enough for </span><span class="c0">Herod</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;to know that the sign pointed to the birth of someone who could be a threat to his own power and position. He hypocritically gave the magi a good-sounding reason for wanting to know the exact location and identity of the Child, but his ultimate purpose was made clear by what he actually did. (MacArthur)</span></p><p class="c2"><span>2:7: Herod asked </span><span class="c0">secretly</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;probably because he did not want anyone to hear his words about worshipping.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c4">2:10: The magi were overwhelmed that the special star that went missing has reappeared to them. Matthew piles up superlatives to emphasize the extent of exhilaration they felt, thus indicating their uniquely strong interest in this great event. (MacArthur)</span></p><p class="c2"><span>2:11: The events described in this passage probably occurred several months after Jesus was born. </span><span class="c0">Mary</span><span>&nbsp;would have completed her period of purification (Lk 2:21-22) of seven days. Jesus, therefore, would already have been circumcised on the eighth day. The fact that Mary offered &quot;a pair of two turtledoves&quot; (Lk 2:24) instead of the normal lamb (Lev 12:6-8) indicates that the family was poor. Had this offering been made after the magi with their expensive </span><span class="c0">gifts</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;had already visited Jesus, the lamb could easily have been afforded and would have been required. (MacArthur)</span></p><p class="c2"><span>2:11: The magi came into the </span><span class="c0">house</span><span>&nbsp;(not the stable)</span><span>&nbsp;and seen the </span><span class="c0">child</span><span>&nbsp;(not a baby)</span><span>. This means that several months, perhaps even a year, have passed already. Another indirect evidence is that Herod would order to kill all children </span><span class="c3">under two years old</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;(v. 16): the age range he had expected Jesus to fall into. A broad range may signify that Jesus was already a year old. Or it may not.</span></p><p class="c2"><span>2:11: </span><span class="c0">house</span><span>&nbsp;(Gk. </span><span class="c3">oikian</span><span>) &mdash; properly, residence, but usually an abode. </span><span class="c0">Child</span><span>&nbsp;(Gk. </span><span class="c3">paidion</span><span class="c4">) &mdash; a childling, i.e., an infant, or a half-grown boy or girl. (Strong&#39;s Dictionary)</span></p><p class="c2"><span>2:11: All the magi seen was a helpless </span><span class="c0">Child</span><span>&nbsp;with His </span><span class="c0">mother</span><span class="c4">. They believed having seen no miracles performed by Him. (John Strohman)</span></p><p class="c2"><span>2:11: Matthew is careful to say that the magi </span><span class="c0">worshipped Him</span><span>, that is, the Child, not his </span><span class="c0">mother</span><span>. They knew better than Cornelius, who attempted to worship the apostle Peter (Ac 10:25). It was also to </span><span class="c0">Him</span><span>&nbsp;that they </span><span class="c0">offered gifts</span><span class="c4">: an expression of worship. (MacArthur)</span></p><p class="c2"><span>2:11: </span><span class="c0">Gold</span><span>: the most precious of metals, the universal symbol of material value and wealth. Also a symbol of nobility and royalty. </span><span class="c0">Frankincense</span><span>: a costly, beautiful-smelling incense that was used only for the most special of occasions, as well as temple worship. </span><span class="c0">Myrrh</span><span>: a valuable perfume, also used as anesthetic. Mixed with other spices, it was used in preparation of bodies for burial<br>Some interpreters suggest that </span><span class="c0">gold</span><span>&nbsp;was a gift for His royalty; </span><span class="c0">frankincense</span><span>&nbsp;&mdash; for His deity (incense of deity, used in the Temple), and </span><span class="c0">myrrh</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;for His mortal humanity. (MacArthur)</span></p><p class="c2"><span>2:12: The </span><span class="c0">warn</span><span class="c4">ing by God suggests direct communication, and that their role in the whole event was by divine design. (MacArthur)</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c4">2:13: God has chosen to protect the family not by miraculously hiding or defending them, but by the very ordinary means of flight to a foreign country. The primary reason is told in v.15: to fulfil a prophecy. (MacArthur)</span></p><p class="c2"><span>2:13: </span><span class="c0">Egypt</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;was a natural asylum. Alexander the great established a sanctuary for Jews in Alexandria (the Egyptian city he named for himself), and the city was still considered a special place of safety and opportunity for Jews. Philo, himself a prominent resident of Alexandria, reported in 40 A.D. that the population included at least one million Jews. In the 3-rd century B.C. a group of Jewish scholars in Alexandria had produced the Septuagint. (MacArthur)</span></p><p class="c2"><span>2:14: We do not know what was done with the gifts (v. 11), but it seems reasonable that they were used to finance the trip to </span><span class="c0">Egypt</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;and to help support the family while there. (MacArthur)</span></p><p class="c2"><span>2:15: The OT writers were the Lord&#39;s spokesmen. Herod&#39;s threat was no surprise to the Lord, who, long before Herod was born, had made plans to foil that wicked king&#39;s plans against the true King. In Hos&nbsp;11:1, the reference to &quot;</span><span class="c0">my son</span><span>&quot; is to the nation Israel. Matthew shows that Jesus&#39; return from Egypt was </span><span class="c3">pictured</span><span>&nbsp;by Israel&#39;s calling from that same country many centuries earlier. The Exodus, therefore, was a type of Jesus&#39; return from Egypt. As God had once brought the people of Israel out of Egypt to be His chosen nation, He now had brought out His greater Son to be the Messiah.<br>A </span><span class="c3">type</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;is a nonverbal prediction: an OT person or event that illustrates some aspect of the person and work of the Lord Jesus Christ in the future but does not specifically describe it. <br>Because types are veiled revelation, divine testimony to their identity must be given by the Holy Spirit in the NT text; we can only safely refer to something as a &quot;type&quot; only if NT identifies it. Ignoring such limits results in the freedom to allegorize, spiritualize, and typify the OT by whimsy. (MacArthur)</span></p><p class="c2"><span>2:16: The work &quot;</span><span class="c0">tricked</span><span>&quot; (or even, &quot;mocked&quot; KJV) refers to </span><span class="c0">Herod</span><span>&#39;s perception of the motives of the </span><span class="c0">magi</span><span class="c4">, not their true intention. It was not their purpose to trick or make sport of the king but simply to obey God&#39;s command. (MacArthur)</span></p><p class="c2"><span>2:16: Those innocent and precious babies of </span><span class="c0">Bethlehem</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;were the first casualties in the now-intensified warfare between the kingdoms of this world and the kingdom of God&#39;s Christ. (MacArthur)</span></p><p class="c2"><span>2:17: The term &quot;</span><span class="c0">fulfilled</span><span>&quot; (from pleroo, &quot;to fill up&quot;) marks this our as completing an OT prediction. This prophecy was also in the form of a </span><span class="c3">type</span><span class="c4">: a non-verbal prediction. </span></p><p class="c2"><span>2:18: It&#39;s not that Matthew has found some random weeping woman in the OT to use in his text. It was at Bethlehem that Jacob buried </span><span class="c0">Rachel</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;(Gen 35:19), the traditional site of whose tomb is still shown to tourists today. (MacArthur)</span></p><p class="c2"><span>2:18: Jeremiah 31:15 was speaking of the great sorrow that would soon be experienced in Israel when most of her people would be carried captive to Babylon. </span><span class="c0">Ramah</span><span>&nbsp;(five miles North of Jerusalem) was a place where Jewish captives were assembled for deportation to Babylon (Jer 40:1). </span><span class="c0">Rachel</span><span>, the mother of Ephraim (often used in the OT as a synonym for the northern kingdom) and Benjamin (whose tribe became part of the southern kingdom) represented the lamentation of all Jewish mothers over Israel&#39;s great tragedy. They also typified and prefigured the monthers of Bethlehem weeping bitterly over the massacre of their children. (MacArthur)</span></p><p class="c2"><span>2:19: Josephus reports that </span><span class="c0">Herod</span><span>&nbsp;&quot;</span><span class="c0">died</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;of this, ulcerated entrails, putrified and maggot-filled organs, constant convulsions, foul breath, and neither physicians nor warm baths led to recovery&quot;. (MacArthur)</span></p><p class="c2"><span>2:20: The fact that the angel spoke of </span><span class="c0">those who sought the Child&#39;s life</span><span>&nbsp;indicates that Herod was not alone in his plans to destroy his supposed rival; but like Herod, the other conspirators were themselves now </span><span class="c0">dead</span><span class="c4">. (MacArthur)</span></p><p class="c2"><span>2:22: </span><span class="c0">Archelaus</span><span>&nbsp;posed another, more general threat. Before his death, </span><span class="c0">Herod</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;had executed two popular Jewish rabbis, Judas and Matthias, who had stirred up their disciples and other faithful Jews in Jerusalem to tear down the offensive Roman eagle that the king had arrogantly erected over the Temple gate. The following Passover, an insurrection broke out, and Archelaus, reflecting his father&#39;s senseless cruelty, executed 3000 Jews, many of whom were Passover pilgrims who had no part in the revolt. Any Jew, therefore, who lived in the territory of Archelaus, was in danger. (MacArthur)</span></p><p class="c2"><span>2:23: They came and resided in </span><span class="c0">Nazareth</span><span>&nbsp;not only because Joseph and Mary were originally from there (Lk 2:4-5), but also by divine providence, that a prophecy </span><span class="c0">might be fulfilled</span><span>.<br>The specific statement, &quot;</span><span class="c0">would be called a Nazarene</span><span>&quot;, does not appear in the OT. Because Matthew speak of &quot;</span><span class="c0">the prophets</span><span class="c4">&quot;, plural, it seems that several prophets had made this prediction, though it has not been recorded in the OT. Matthew&#39;s original readers were largely Jewish, and this prophecy probably was common knowledge among them. For later readers, the Holy Spirit obviously felt it was enough that we simply know that the prediction was made and that it was fulfilled as Matthew explains. (MacArthur)</span></p><p class="c2"><span>2:23: The town of </span><span class="c0">Nazareth</span><span>&nbsp;was inhabited largely by people noted for their crude and violent ways. The term &quot;</span><span class="c0">Nazarene</span><span>&quot; ahd long been a term of derision, used to describe any person who was rough and rude. (The reason behind Nathanael&#39;s surprise in Jn 1:46, &quot;can any good thing come our of Nazareth?&quot;. He was shocked that the Messiah actually could come from such a disreputable place). <br>The early Jewish persecutors of the church apparently considered Jesus&#39; being from Nazareth as evidence that He could </span><span class="c3">not</span><span>&nbsp;be the Messian, rather than, as Matthew tells us, a sign that He was. Tertullus spoke of Paul as &quot;a real pest... and a ringleader of the sect of the Nazarenes&quot; (Ac 24:5). The church Father Jerome wrote that in synagogue prayers Christians were often cursed as Nazarenes. Jesus&#39; birthplace gave Him a name, Jesus the Nazarene, that would be used as a title of reproach, thus fulfilling many other prophecies that depict the Messiah as &quot;despised and forsaken of men&quot;&nbsp;(Is&nbsp;53:3). </span><span class="c4">(MacArthur)</span></p><h3 class="c7" id="h.cvv294w11e77"><span class="c11 c0">Chapter 3</span></h3><p class="c2"><span class="c4">3:1: Nearly 30 years had elapsed between chapters 2 and 3. (MacArthur)</span></p><p class="c2"><span>3:1: &quot;</span><span class="c0">John</span><span class="c4">&quot; means &quot;Yahweh is gracious&quot;. (MacArthur)</span></p><p class="c2"><span>3:1: In the world, greatness is normally measured by fame and wealth. Although </span><span class="c0">John</span><span>&nbsp;comes from a priestly family, there were many such descendants of Aaron, so they had no special dignity of recognition. When John went to live in the </span><span class="c0">wilderness</span><span>&nbsp;(when he was young; see Lk 1:80: &quot;he lived in the deserts&quot;), he forsook even what little social and economic status he had, existing much like a hermit. &nbsp;</span><span>He forsook his earthly father&#39;s ministry for the sake of his heavenly Father&#39;s.</span><span><br>Yet Luke recorded of him, &quot;for he will be great in the sight of the Lord&quot;&nbsp;(Lk&nbsp;1:15). That man was a sovereignly designed and chosen herald for the great King. His greatness was related to his calling: a herald of the Messiah, the One who was greater still.<br></span><span class="c0">John</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;knew of his position and task. As a child John no doubt had been told many times of the angel&#39;s announcement of his birth and purpose, a purpose from which he never wavered, compromised, or tried to gain personal recognition or advantage.<br>(MacArthur)</span></p><p class="c2"><span>3:1: &quot;</span><span class="c0">Came</span><span>&quot; (Gk. </span><span class="c3">paraginomai</span><span>, to approach, to appear publicly) was often used to indicate an official arrival, such as that of the magi in Mt 2:1. The primary meaning of &quot;</span><span class="c0">preaching</span><span>&quot; (Gk. </span><span class="c3">kerusso</span><span>) is &quot;to herald&quot;: used of the official whose duty it was to proclaim loudly and extensively the coming of the king. After spending most of his life in the </span><span class="c0">desert</span><span class="c4">, at the right moment God spoke to his heart, and he began to thunder out the message God had given him in that desert. (MacArthur)</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c4">3:2: &ldquo;John baptized with the baptism of repentance, telling the people to believe in the one who was to come after him, that is, Jesus.&rdquo; (Paul, Acts 19:4)</span></p><p class="c2"><span>3:2: John&#39;s message could easily be summarized in one word: </span><span class="c0">repent</span><span>&nbsp;(Gk. </span><span class="c3">metanoeo</span><span>). This word means more than regret or sorrow (cf. Heb 12:17, where repentance can be sought with tears, but nevertheless, not found); it means to turn around, to change direction, to change the mind and will. It denotes a change from wrong to right, away from sin and to righteousness. It involves sorrow &quot;that produces a repentance ... leading to salvation&quot; (2 Cor 7:10). Therefore, John&#39;s &quot;</span><span class="c0">repent</span><span class="c4">&quot; can be rendered &quot;be converted&quot;. (MacArthur)</span></p><p class="c2"><span>3:2: Baptism is more than just a ritual; one has to </span><span class="c0">repent</span><span class="c4">, i.e. make the decision to turn around completely and abandon the life of sin. It is not just feeling sorry, or changing one&#39;s mind, but a complete alteration of the basic motivation and direction of one&#39;s life (John Strohman). In vv.7-8 John speaks to those who, being religious, did not truly repent, calling them &ldquo;brood of vipers&rdquo;. Another emphasis on repentance is in v.11.</span></p><p class="c2"><span>3:2: Jesus has began His preaching with exactly the same message (Mk 1:15: &quot;</span><span class="c0">repent</span><span>&nbsp;and believe in the gospel&quot;; Mt 4:17: &quot;</span><span class="c0">repent</span><span>, for the Kingdom of Heaven is at hand&quot;; Lk 5:32: &quot;I have not come to call the righteous but sinners to </span><span class="c0">repentance</span><span>&quot;). The apostles began their preaching with the same message (Mk 6:12: &quot;So they went out and proclaimed that people should </span><span class="c0">repent</span><span>&quot;). In his Pentecost sermon, Peter&#39;s concluding words were, &quot;</span><span class="c0">Repent</span><span>&nbsp;and be baptized every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ for the forgiveness of your sins&quot; (Ac 2:38). That&#39;s also what Paul declared throughout the whole world (Ac 26:20: &quot;they should </span><span class="c0">repent</span><span>&nbsp;and turn to God, performing deeds in keeping with their </span><span class="c0">repentance</span><span class="c4">&quot;). &nbsp;(MacArthur)</span></p><p class="c2"><span>3:2: The </span><span class="c3">message</span><span>&nbsp;was &quot;</span><span class="c0">repent</span><span>&quot;; the </span><span class="c3">motive</span><span>&nbsp;was </span><span class="c0">the kingdom of heaven is at hand</span><span>.

The </span><span class="c3">present</span><span>&nbsp;kingdom, the one that existed at the time of John and the one that was &quot;</span><span class="c0">at hand</span><span>&quot;. 3. An </span><span class="c3">interim</span><span>&nbsp;kingdom: that resulted because of Israel&#39;s rejection. The King returned to heaven and His kingdom on earth now exists only in a mystery form. God does not presently exercise His full divine will over the earth, being, so to speak, in a voluntary exile in heaven, and He reigns only in the hearts of those who know Him. 4. The </span><span class="c3">manifest</span><span>&nbsp;kingdom, the Millenium, in which Christ will rule directly, both internally (in the hearts) and externally (over all mankind). 5. The </span><span class="c3">eternal</span><span>&nbsp;kingdom.<br>Had Israel accepted their King, there would be no interim kingdom. The </span><span class="c0">kingdom at hand</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;would have become the kingdom of a thousand years. But because they killed the King, the millennial kingdom was sovereignly postponed. (MacArthur)</span></p><p class="c2"><span>3:3: In ancient times it was common for a herald to precede the arrival of the monarch, to announce his coming and to </span><span class="c0">prepare</span><span>&nbsp;for his safe and proper travel. They would make sure that the roadway was as smooth and uncluttered as possible: holes would be filled, rocks and debris would be removed, and unsightly litter would be burned or hidden. The twofold duty was to proclaim and to </span><span class="c0">prepare</span><span class="c4">. This is what John&#39;s ministry did for God&#39;s great King. (MacArthur)</span></p><p class="c2"><span>3:3: As herald of the great King, John sought to clear men&#39;s hearts of the obstacles that kept them from the King. The </span><span class="c0">way of the Lord</span><span>&nbsp;is the way of repentance, of turning from sin to righteousness, of turning moral and spiritual </span><span class="c0">paths</span><span>&nbsp;that are crooked into ones that are </span><span class="c0">straight</span><span>.</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;(MacArthur)</span></p><p class="c2"><span>3:3: </span><span class="c0">Isaiah</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;goes on to say: &quot;Every valley shall be lifted up, and every mountain and hill be made low; the uneven ground shall become level, and the rough places a plain.

Even the announcer dresses in the best suits, stays in the best hotels, contacts only the best people, and makes preparations for the monarch to visit only the best places. But that was not God&#39;s plan for the heralding of His Son. John the Baptist was born of obscure parents, dressed strangely even for his day, and carried out his ministry mostly in out-of-the-way and unattractive places. (MacArthur)</span></p><p class="c2"><span>3:4: Neither </span><span class="c0">John</span><span class="c4">&#39;s food nor clothes were like those of the Pharisees and Scribes, who dressed and ate luxuriously. John&#39;s plain food and clothes can be seen as a rebuke to the hypocritical and self-indulgent practices of religious leaders (John Strohman)</span></p><p class="c2"><span>3:4: </span><span class="c0">John</span><span>&#39;s figure must have been startling: God&#39;s messenger, but one that did not live, dress, or talk like other religious leaders, who were proper, well-dressed, well-fed, sophisticated, and worldly. </span><span class="c0">John</span><span>&#39;s </span><span class="c0">garment</span><span>&nbsp;was as plain and grab as the wilderness in which he lived, and his diet was as spartan as his clothing: nourishing, but little else. </span><span class="c0">John</span><span class="c4">&#39;s very dress, food, and life-style were in themselves a rebuke to the self-satisfied and self-indulgent religious leaders of Israel, as well as a rebuke for others who admired and longed for the same advantages which they did not have. (MacArthur)</span></p><p class="c2"><span>3:4: (</span><span class="c1">Pharisees vs John</span><span>) At the time of Christ, the Pharisees were the chief promoters of pervasive legalistic and ritualistic system. Over the centuries various rabbis had interpreted and reinterpreted the Jewish Scriptiures until those interpretations &mdash; known as the traditions of the elders &mdash; became more authoritative than Scripture itself. The essence of the traditions was a system of dos and don&rsquo;ts that gradually expanded to cover almost every aspect of Jewish life. Total observance was impossible and doubtlessly resulted in terrible feelings of guilt. Som religious leaders developed the idea that if a person could perfectly keep just a few of the laws, God would understand.<br></span><span class="c0">John</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;was radically different from the scribes, Pharisees, Sadducees and priests, and it was obvious that he did not bother to observe most of the religious traditions. He was a breath of fresh air in a stifling, never-ending system of demands and prohibitions. This has probably contributed to the initial popularity of John the Baptist: people wanted someone who could show them how to be forgiven, someone who would show the way of salvation, the real was to please God, the true way of peace and relief frm sin. (MacArthur)</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c4">3:5: John called people away from the corrupt and dead religious system of his day: away from ritualism, worldliness, hypocrisy and superficiality. He called away from the cities into the wilderness, where most people would not bother to go if they were not serious seekers. (MacArthur)</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c4">3:5: The people were travelling a considerable distance because they recognized John as a prophet (Mt 21:26: &quot;they all hold that John was a prophet&quot;). (MacArthur)</span></p><p class="c2"><span>3:6: That those Jews submitted to </span><span class="c0">being baptized</span><span>&nbsp;was more than a little significant, because that was not a traditional Jewish ceremony. It was completely different from the Levitical washings, which consisted of washing the hands, feet, and head, and were repeated: repeated purification for repeated sinning. <br>John&#39;s washing, however, was one-time. The only one-time washing the Jews performed was for Gentiles, signifying their coming as outsiders into the true faith of Judaism. A Jew who submitted to such a rite demonstrated, in effect, that he was an outsider who sought entrance into the people of God: an amazing admission for a Jew. Members of God&#39;s chosen race, descendants of Abraham, heirs of the covenant of Moses, came to John to be </span><span class="c0">baptized</span><span>&nbsp;like a Gentile!<br>The act symbolized before the world that they realized their national and racial descent, or even their calling as God&#39;s chosen and covenant people, could not save them. They had to repent, forsake sin, and trust in the Lord for salvation. They had to come into the kingdom just like the Gentiles, through repentance and faith &mdash; which included a public </span><span class="c0">confession</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;of sins. (MacArthur)</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c4">3:6: We know that many of those acts of repentance must have been superficial and hypocritical, because John soon lost much of his following. (MacArthur)</span></p><p class="c2"><span>3:7-13: The parallel account of John&#39;s preaching in Lk 3:10-14 gives more details; but the message is the same: a call to repentance and baptism, an inner change of mind and heart, along with an outward act that symbolized that change, and along with a manner of living that </span><span class="c3">demonstrated</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;the change. (MacArthur)</span></p><p class="c2"><span>3:7: </span><span class="c0">The Pharisees</span><span>. Jesus exposed them as doing &quot;all their deeds to be seen by others&quot; (Mt 23:5). The word </span><span class="c3">Pharisee</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;means &quot;separated ones&quot;, and members of the sect diligently tried to live up to their name. They separated themselves from everyone whom they considered to be base &quot;sinners&quot;. After leaving any public gathering, they would perform ceremonial washings to purify themselves of possible contamination from touching some unclean person.<br>Upon admission to the group, there was a period of probation lasting up to one year, during which the applicant had to prove his ability to follow ritual law. They formed a self-righteous, &quot;holy&quot; community of legalistic isolationists who had no regard or respect for those outside their sect (Jn 7:49: &quot;this crowd that does not know the law is accursed&quot;). They considered themselves to be superspiritual and the only true Israel, but their &quot;spirituality&quot; was entirely external, consisting of the pursuit of meticulous observance of a multitude of religious rituals and taboos, most of which they had devised over the centuries as supplements to the law of Moses. These were known collectively as &quot;the tradition of the elders&quot;, concerning which Jesus gave the Pharisees one of His strongest rebukes, charging them with &quot;teaching as doctrines the precepts of men&quot; (Mt 15:2-9).<br>By the time of Christ, the Pharisees had lost most of whatever nationalism they may earlier have had. Another sect, the Zealots, had become the association for those whose primary concern was Jewish independence. The Pharisees&#39; single loyalty was to themselves, to their traditions and to their own influence and prestige. By their strict adherence to those traditions they expected to reap great reward in heaven. But they were the epitome of religious emptiness and hypocrisy, as Jesus often pointed out (MacArthur)</span></p><p class="c2"><span>3:7: </span><span class="c0">The Sadducees</span><span class="c4">. The name may be derived from Zadok, the priest under David. &nbsp;Also arose during the intertestamental period, but from among the priestly aristocracy, and in the NT times, the priests were mostly sadducees. They were compromisers, cared little for Greek culture of philosophy and intellectualism, but were greatly attracted to the pragmatic, practical Romans.<br>They claimed to accept the law of Moses, but scorned the legalistic traditions of the Pharisees, and cared little for religion, especially doctrine. They denied the existence of angels, the resurrection, even spirits, and most things supernatural. Consequently, they lived only for the present, getting everything they could from whomever they could. They believed in extreme human autonomy and in the unlimited freedom of the will. They considered themselves masters of their own destinies.<br>They were fewer, and extremely wealthy. Under Annas, they ran the Temple franchise: the money exchanging and the sale of sacrificial animals, and charged exorbitantly for those services. It was therefore the Sadducees&#39; business that Jesus damaged (Mt 21:12-13).<br>Because of their great wealth, Temple racketeering, and affiliation with the Romans, the Sadducees were much less popular with their fellow Jews. (MacArthur)</span></p><p class="c2"><span>3:7: </span><span class="c0">The Pharisees and the Sadducees</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;had almost nothing in common. The P. were ritualistic; the S. were rationalistic. THe P. were strict separatists; the S. comprising collaborators. The p. were commoners (most of them had a trade), while the S. were aristocrats. Both groups had members among the scribes and were represented in the priesthood, and in the Sanhedrin; yet they were in almost constant opposition to each other. During NT times, about the only common ground they exhibited was opposition to Christ and His followers.<br>The P. expected their reward in heaven, while the S. expected theirs in this life, but the trust of both groups was in personal works and self-effort. Both emphasized the superficial and nonessential, and had no concern for the genuine inner spiritual life of for the welfare of their fellow man. That was &quot;the leaven of the Pharisees and Sadducees,&quot; the hypocritical, self-serving, dead externalism about which Jesus warned His disciples (Mt 16:6). (MacArthur)</span></p><p class="c2"><span>3:7: The Pharisees and Sadducees were </span><span class="c0">coming to his baptism</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;likely not to be baptized, but to check as thoroughly as they could whether John might indeed be a prophet, as many of the people believed. Whatever their reasons were, they were wrong, wicked reasons. (MacArthur)</span></p><p class="c2"><span>3:7: It may seem strange: why is John so harsh to them? It is because these </span><span class="c0">Pharisees</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;did not repent, nor did they come to be baptized; they actually came to condemn John (see Lk 7:30: they &quot;rejected the purpose of God&quot; in John). John, being a prophet, sees in their hearts, and responds to them immediately.</span></p><p class="c2"><span>3:7: </span><span class="c0">John</span><span>&#39;s awareness of their insincerity and lack of repentance of the Pharisees is evident in those strong words: as </span><span class="c0">John</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;well knew, they had not confessed their sins; they had not changed at all. They were not genuinely seeking the true righteousness that delivers from judgment. (MacArthur).</span></p><p class="c2"><span>3:7: He calls them </span><span class="c0">vipers</span><span>&nbsp;because of their hypocritical self-righteousness. They thought themselves to be saved through their dead works. </span><span class="c3">Dead works</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;is an attempt to earn God&#39;s forgiveness by one&#39;s conduct: the good things we do; the bad things we don&#39;t do; and religious acts we engage in. This is self-righteousness, it will not save anyone from hell. Salvation comes through repentance and God&#39;s forgiveness obtained through faith in Jesus. Even repentance is a gift from God (2 Tim 2:25; Rom 2:4). </span></p><p class="c2"><span>3:7: </span><span class="c0">Vipers</span><span>&nbsp;(</span><span class="c3">echidna</span><span>) were small but very poisonous desert snakes. When still, they looked like a dead branch and were often picked up unintentionally. This is exactly what Paul did when gathering firewood (Act 28:3). By calling them a </span><span class="c0">brood</span><span>&nbsp;(offspring) of </span><span class="c0">vipers</span><span>, John pointed that: 1) their wicked work had been passed on to them by the original serpent; 2) they appeared to be harmless, but their brand of godliness was venomous and deadly, as they &quot;shut off the kingdom of heaven from men&quot; (Mt 23:13). (MacArthur)</span></p><p class="c2"><span>3:7-9: &ldquo;</span><span class="c0">Who warned you to flee from the wrath to come?</span><span>&rdquo; &mdash; meaning, &ldquo;Do you really think that you don&#39;t need to </span><span class="c0">repent</span><span>, but will escape the Final Judgment because you are Jews, descendants of </span><span class="c0">Abraham</span><span class="c4">??!&rdquo;. In terms of salvation, it means nothing.</span></p><p class="c2"><span>3:7: The question &quot;</span><span class="c0">who warned you to flee</span><span>&quot; continues the viper figure: after the harvest, a farmer would start a brush-fire, and burning stalks would cause vipers and other creatures to </span><span class="c0">flee</span><span>&nbsp;before the flames. It was a common sight. The implication is that the Pharisees and Sadducees were expecting John&#39;s baptism to give protection from the flames of </span><span class="c0">the wrath to come</span><span class="c4">. It was satan, and not genuine fear of God&#39;s judgment, that led them out to hear John and to seek his baptism as a pretentions formality.

(MacArthur)</span></p><p class="c2"><span>3:8: Salvation is not verified by a past act, but by present </span><span class="c0">fruit</span><span>fulness. The marks of a truly repentant heart are </span><span class="c0">fruit in keeping with repentance</span><span class="c4">. But, as James points out, a faith that has no works is dead (Jas 2:17). (MacArthur)</span></p><p class="c2"><span>3:8: </span><span class="c3">Axios</span><span>&nbsp;(</span><span class="c0">in keeping with</span><span>) has the root idea of having equal weight or worth, and therefore of being appropriate. True </span><span class="c0">repentance</span><span>&nbsp;not only should, but </span><span class="c3">will</span><span class="c4">, have correspondingly genuine works, demonstrated in both attitudes and actions. Right relationship with God brings right relationship to our fellow human beings. Those who claim to know Christ, who claim to be born again, will demonstrate a new way of living that corresponds to the new birth. (MacArthur)</span></p><p class="c2"><span>3:8: John actually explained how to </span><span class="c0">bear fruit</span><span>s of repentance. In v.2, he says: &quot;make His paths straight&quot;. What paths? The paths of human lives: the </span><span class="c0">fruit</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;is a change of the course of one&#39;s life.</span></p><p class="c2"><span>3:8: Theologian Erich Sauer speaks of </span><span class="c0">repentance</span><span>&nbsp;as &quot;a threefold action: in the understanding, it means and knowledge of sin; in the feelings, it means pain and grief; and in the will, it means a change of mind&quot; and appropriate actions. <br>1. Recognition of personal sin is the important first step. But by itself it is useless, even dangerous, because it tends to make a person think that mere recognition is all that is necessary. (Ex 9:27: a hardened pharaoh admitted his sin; 1 Sam 15:24: an insincere Saul confessed his; Lk 18:23: a young rich man went away sorrowful but not repentant; Mt 27:4: even Judas despaired over his betrayal of Jesus; all of these men recognized their sin, yet none of them repented. They were experiencing what Paul called &quot;the sorrow of the world&quot; that &quot;produces death&quot; instead of the &quot;godly sorrow&quot; that &quot;produces a repentance&quot; (2 Cor 7:10)).<br>2. True repentance &nbsp;will include a deep </span><span class="c3">feeling</span><span>&nbsp;of wrongdoing and sin against God. It&#39;s a sorrow for offense against a holy God. Sorrow over being found out or over suffering hardship or discipline because of our sin is not godly sorrow, and has nothing to do with repentance; that sort of sorrow is but selfish regret, concern for self rather than for God. It merely adds to the original sin.<br>3. Acknowledgement and feeling do not complete repentance. If it is genuine, it will result in a changed life that bears </span><span class="c0">fruit in keeping with repentance</span><span>. &quot;Create in me a clean heart&quot; (Ps 51:10,13). </span><span class="c0">Fruit</span><span>&nbsp;is always seen in Scripture as manifested behavior (cf. Mt 7:20: &nbsp;&quot;you will recognize them by their fruit&quot;).</span><span class="c4"><br>(MacArthur)</span></p><p class="c2"><span>3:8: Luke gives several examples of the kind of </span><span class="c0">fruit</span><span>&nbsp;John was talking about: share when you have two tunics or food (Lk 3:11), collect no more than you have to (Lk 3:13), do not extort or slander (Lk 3:14). John says, &quot;the one who practices righteousness is righteous&quot; (1 Jn 3:7); and that &quot;if someone says, &#39;I love God&#39;, and hates his brother, he is a liar; for the one who does not love his brother whom he has seen, cannot love God whom he has not seen&quot; (1 Jn 4:20). Our actions </span><span class="c3">toward our fellow men</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>are indicators of our true attitude toward God. (To </span><span class="c3">men</span><span>; not to some religious stuff! &mdash; me).</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;(MacArthur)</span></p><p class="c2"><span>3:8: Ultimately, </span><span class="c0">repentance</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;like that is a gift of God. (Ac 5:31: Jesus was exalted &quot;to grant repentance to Israel, and forgiveness of sins&quot;; Ac 11:18: &quot;God has granted to the Gentiles also the repentance that leads to life&quot;; 2 Tim 2:25-26: ...that &quot;God may grant them repentance&quot;). (MacArthur)</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c4">3:8: That God fully and freely remits the sins of a penitent is a basic doctrine of Judaism, and was no news to the Pharisees and Sadducees. Rabbis said, &quot;a man can shooot an arrow for a few furlongs, but repentance reaches to the throne of God&quot;. Some rabbis maintained that repentance was created even before the Law. The clear meaning of repentance in Judaism has always been a change in man&#39;s attitude toward God that results in a moral and religious reformation of the individual&#39;s conduct. The great medieval Jewish scholar, Maimonides, said of the traditional Jewish concept of repentance: &quot;What is repentance? Repentance is that the sinner forsakes his sin, puts it out of his thoughts, and fully resolves in his mind that he will never do it again&quot;.<br>P.S. Repentance in the OT: Ezek 33:18-19; Hos 14:1-2; Jon 3:10; Is 1:16-17. <br>(MacArthur)</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c4">3:8: John had seen absolutely no evidence of true repentance, and he demanded to see such evidence before he would baptize them. John&#39;s words to those religious leaders was at once a rebuke and an invitation. &quot;You have shown no evidence of repentance, but now you have opportunity to truly repent if you mean it. Show me that you have turned from your wicked hypocrisy to genuine godliness, and I will be glad to baptize you.&quot; (MacArthur)</span></p><p class="c2"><span>3:9: Many Jews of NT times believed, and many Orthodox Jews of our own say still believe, that simply their Jewishness assures them a place in God&#39;s kingdom. The rabbis taught that &quot;all Israelites have a portion in the world to come&quot;. They spoke of the &quot;delivering merits of the fathers,&quot; who passed on spiritual merit to their descendants. Some even taught that </span><span class="c0">Abraham</span><span>&nbsp;stood guard at the gates of Gehenna, or hell, turning back any Israelite who happened that way.<br>The Jews generally considered Gentiles to be the occupants of hell: spiritually lifeless and hopeless, dead stones. It may be that John played on that figure in declaring that &quot;God is able from these </span><span class="c0">stones</span><span>&nbsp;to raise up children to </span><span class="c0">Abraham</span><span>&quot;; that is, true children of Abraham who come to the Lord as Abraham did, by faith.<br>John&#39;s message of preparation for the coming of the King was repentance, conversion, and a demand for a completely different life &mdash; which must have been startling news for Jews who thought that children of Abraham were unconditionally assured of the promised King. John knew what they were probably thinking, and continued, saying that God was not interested in His people&#39;s human heritage, but in their spiritual life. John&#39;s point was simple: &quot;Unless you repent and are converted from sin to righteousness, you are in the same condition as the Gentiles and have no right to the Kingdom.&quot; Some Jews would be saved, but none apart from personal repentance and conversion.<br>Jesus contradicted the similar claims of another group of Pharisees: &quot;If you are </span><span class="c0">Abraham</span><span class="c4">&#39;s children, do the deeds of Abraham&quot; (Jn 8:39-40). Our Lord went on to say that their deeds proved that their father was actually satan. In Jesus&#39; story of the rich man and Lazarus, it is overlooked that the rich man in hell addresses Abraham as &quot;Father&quot;, and Abraham, speaking from heaven, calls him his &quot;Child&quot; (Lk 16:25-26). A child of Abraham in hell was beyond their thinking. As with Mt 8:10-12, where Jesus plainly says that &quot;the sons of the kingdom shall be cast out into the outer darkness&quot;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>(MacArthur)</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c4">3:9: Descent from Abraham is a great advantage in knowing and understanding God&#39;s will (Rom 3:1-2: much benefit; Rom 9:4-5: &quot;to them belong the adoption, the glory, the covenants, the giving of the law, the worship, and the promises&quot;), but without faith in Him that advantage becomes a more severe condemnation. (MacArthur)</span></p><p class="c2"><span>3:10: At the end of every harvest season, the farmer would go through his vineyard or orchard looking for plants that had borne </span><span class="c0">no fruit</span><span>. These would be </span><span class="c0">cut down</span><span>&nbsp;to make room for productive vines and trees and to keep them from taking nutrients from the soil that were needed by the good plants. A fruitless tree was a worthless and useless tree, fit only to be </span><span class="c0">cut down and thrown into the fire</span><span class="c4">. Fruitless repentance is worthless and useless; it means absolutely nothing to God. (MacArthur)</span></p><p class="c2"><span>3:10: The OT prophets, judgment was closely connected with salvation in the coming of the Messiah: those men of God saw no gap between His coming to save and His coming to judge. Apparently, John also believed that God&#39;s ultimate judgment was imminent: </span><span class="c0">fire</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;was a frequent biblical symbol fo the torment of divine punishment and judgment. John&#39;s preaching picked up where Malachi left off (Mal 4:1: evildoers burned on the day like in a furnace). (MacArthur)</span></p><p class="c2"><span>3:11: Baptism with the </span><span class="c0">Spirit</span><span>&nbsp;gives the ability to repent and live a holy life; </span><span class="c0">Fire</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;purifies the believer, makes him holy.</span></p><p class="c2"><span>3:11: </span><span class="c0">Baptism</span><span>&nbsp;means immersion. </span><span class="c0">Baptism with fire</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;is therefore an immersion into fire.</span></p><p class="c2"><span>3:11: With the message of judgment, John also gives a measure of hope and consolation, speaking specifically of the Messiah, who had come in order that no one need face God&#39;s judgment. First, John explains how his baptism differed from that of the Messiah. <br>John&#39;s </span><span class="c0">baptism</span><span>&nbsp;reflected a ritual the Jews often used when a Gentile accepted the God of Israel. The ceremony was the mark of an outsider becoming a part of the chosen people. In John&#39;s ministry it marked the outward profession of inward </span><span class="c0">repentance</span><span>, which prepared a person for the coming of the King. <br>The second </span><span class="c0">baptism</span><span>&nbsp;is by the Messiah and with </span><span class="c0">the Holy Spirit</span><span>, who came at Pentecost, baptizing the disciples and establishing them in the body of Christ (ac 2:1-4). It is the Spirit that had been promised in the OT (Joel 2:28: &quot;will pour out on all mankind&quot;; Ezek 36:25-26: &quot;give them a new heart and put a new spirit withing them&quot;), when men would be at last baptized in the very power and person of God Himself.<br>The third baptism mentioned here is that of </span><span class="c0">fire</span><span>. Many interpreters take this to be a part of the Holy Spirit baptism at Pentecost, which was accompanied by &quot;tongues </span><span class="c1">as of</span><span>&nbsp;of fire&quot;. But they were not fire, just looked like licks of fire. Also, when other people who were baptized with the Holy Spirit, no fire was present (Ac 10:44: Cornelius). Other interpreters take the </span><span class="c0">fire</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;to represent a spiritual cleansing, as described in Ezekiel; but nothing in the passage relates to cleansing fire. Consequently, it seems best to consider fire as representing God&#39;s coming judgment, as is so frequently in Scripture. Also, in both preceding and following verses (vv. 10, 12), John clearly uses fire to represent judgment and punishment. It is impossible that the middle reference to fire would concern an entirely different subject. Both of the adjoining verses contrast the fates of believers and unbelievers, those who bear good fruit and those who do not (v. 10), and the valuable wheat and the worthless chaff (v. 12). It therefore seems logical and natural to take v. 11 also as a contrast between believers (those baptized with the Holy Spirit) and unbelievers (those baptized with the fire of God&#39;s judgment).<br>(MacArthur)</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c4">3:11: One of the lowliest tasks of a slave in that day was removing the sandals of his master and any guests and then washing their feet. It was the symbol Jesus Himself used in teaching His disciples to be servants (Jn 13:5-15). The humility of John, one mark of his spiritual stature, is evident in this description of the One he heralded.</span></p><p class="c2"><span>3:12: Those that belong to Jesus will be </span><span class="c0">clear</span><span>ed and </span><span class="c0">gather</span><span>ed; those that do not belong to Him will be </span><span class="c0">burn</span><span class="c4">ed.</span></p><p class="c2"><span>3:12: In Palestine, as in many other parts of the ancient world, farmers made a </span><span class="c0">threshing floor</span><span>&nbsp;by picking out a slight depression in the ground, or digging one if necessary, usually on a hill where breezes could be caught. The soil would then be wetted and packed down until it was very hard. Around the perimeter of the floor, which was perhaps 30 or 40 feet in diameter, rocks would be stacked to keep the grain in place. After the stals of grain were placed onto the floor, an ox, or a team of oxen, would drag heavy pieces of wood around over the grain, separating the </span><span class="c0">wheat</span><span>&nbsp;kernels from the </span><span class="c0">chaff</span><span>, or straw. Then the farmer would take a </span><span class="c0">winnowing fork</span><span>&nbsp;and throw a pile of grain into the air. The wind would blow the chaff away, while the kernels, being heavier, would fall back to the floor. Eventually, nothing would be left but the good and useful </span><span class="c0">wheat</span><span>.<br>In a similar way the Messiah will separate out everyone who belongs to Him and, like a farmer, </span><span class="c0">He will gather His wheat into the barn</span><span>, where it will be forever safe and protected. Also, in a similar way, </span><span class="c0">He will burn up the chaff with unquenchable fire</span><span class="c4">. The long-awaited Messiah will Himself perform both functions, though not in the time and sequence that John and the prophets before him may have thought. The final separation and the ultimate judgment will be only at Christ&#39;s second coming.<br>(MacArthur)</span></p><p class="c2"><span>3:13: </span><span class="c0">Then</span><span class="c4">. At this point, Jesus &quot;was about 30 years of age&quot; (Lk 3:23), and John was about six months older than Jesus (Lk 1:26). John must have preached for a while already; perhaps, nearly a year (Lk 3:1-2). (MacArthur)</span></p><p class="c2"><span>3:13: As with the magi, </span><span class="c0">came</span><span>&nbsp;(</span><span class="c3">paraginomai</span><span class="c4">; better, &quot;arrived&quot;) is a word that was often used to indicate an official or public appearance. Matthew continues describing the life of the King: His ancestry, His arrival, His adoration, His attestation, His announcement, and now, His annointing. (MacArthur)</span></p><p class="c2"><span>3:13: Jesus </span><span class="c0">came from </span><span>from Nazareth (Mk 1:9) in </span><span class="c0">Galilee</span><span>, probably to a place near Jericho (Jn 1:18: Bethany beyound the Jordan). That&#39;s 130km, and it has taken Him more than 5 days to get there (a traveller could cover as much as 25km a day on foot). Jesus came </span><span class="c0">to John</span><span>&nbsp;specifically </span><span class="c0">to be baptized by him</span><span class="c4">: the purpose of the Journey. (MacArthur)</span></p><p class="c2"><span>3:14: The idea of Jesus&#39; being </span><span class="c0">baptized</span><span>&nbsp;by John was unthinkable to him (</span><span class="c3">diekoluen</span><span class="c4">: he &quot;kept trying to prevent Him&quot;), for John knew his divine identity (Jn 1:29: &quot;Behold, the Lamb of God!&quot;). John&#39;s baptism was for confession of sin and repentance, but Jesus had no sins to confess or be forgiven of. John did not directly contradict Jesus, as Peter would do (Mt 16:22), but he thought that he surely misunderstood what Jesus intended, that He could not possibly mean what He seemed to be saying. John&#39;s baptism for repentance from sin was totally inappropriate for Jesus: the one who &quot;takes away the in of the world&quot; (Jn 1:29) cannot himself be sinful. (MacArthur)</span></p><p class="c2"><span>3:14: John resisted </span><span class="c0">baptizing</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;Jesus for exactly the opposite reason that he resisted baptizing the Pharisees and Sadducees: those were in great need of repentance but were unwilling to ask for it and gave no evidence of having it; Jesus, by contrast, alone of all mankind had no need of repentance (Heb 4:15: &quot;yet without sin&quot;). Pharisees were totally unworthy of it; Jesus was too worthy for it. (MacArthur)</span></p><p class="c2"><span>3:15: &quot;</span><span class="c0">Permit it this time</span><span>&quot; was an idiom meaning that the act, though not seemingly appropriate, was indeed appropriate for this special </span><span class="c0">time</span><span>. Jesus gave permission for John to do what, without divine instruction, he would never have been willing to do, because of his deep spiritual commitment and sincerity. His baptism was important for both of their ministries, &quot;</span><span class="c0">for us</span><span>&quot;</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;to fulfill all righteousness</span><span class="c4">, for God&#39;s plan to be perfectly fulfilled. There was no other way to fulfill all righteousness. (MacArthur)</span></p><p class="c2"><span>3:15: Why did Jesus want to submit Himself to an act that testified to confession and repentance of sin? Views: &nbsp;</span><span class="c13">1) He intended His baptism to be a sort of initiatory rite for His high priesthood, reflecting the ceremony which prepared the OT priests for their ministry. &nbsp;2) Jesus wanted to identify Himself with the Gentiles, who were initiated into Judaism as proselytes by the act of baptism. &nbsp;3) To endorse John&#39;s authority, to accredit of John as a true prophet of God and the genuine forerunner of His own ministry. &nbsp;4) He intended to be baptized vicariously for the sins of mankind, making His baptism, along with His atoning death on the cross, a part of His sin-bearing, redemptive work. &nbsp;5) Gnostics believed that until His baptism, Jesus was just an ordinary man, sinful like every other man, and baptism was therefore necessary to purify Him and make Him suitable to receive the &quot;Christ Spirit&quot;, by which He was endowed with deity by the divine </span><span class="c3 c13">logos</span><span class="c13">. Like the rest of the Gnostic views, this idea does not square with Scripture: Jesus was </span><span class="c3 c13">born</span><span class="c13">&nbsp;the Son of God (Lk 1:32, 35) and was called &quot;Immanuel&quot; even before His birth.<br></span><span class="c4">But none fit the context. It seems that one reason Jesus submitted to baptism was to give an example of obedience to His followers. As with taxes: Jesus may not have had an ultimate obligation to pay taxes to human government (Mt 17: 26: &quot;the sons [of the kingdom] are exempt&quot;), but He modeled obedience.<br>Jesus came into the world to identify with men; and to identify with men is to identify with sin. His baptism represented the willing identification with the sinful people He came to save. He who had no sin took His place among those who had no righteousness. (MacArthur)</span></p><p class="c2"><span>3:16: John&#39;s </span><span class="c0">baptism</span><span>&nbsp;represented cleansing, or washing, from sin. Christian baptism </span><span class="c0">represents</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;the believer&#39;s identification with Christ&#39;s death and ressurrection (Rom 6:4 &amp;&amp; Col 2:12: &quot;we are buried with Him in baptism&quot;). Jesus made only two other references to personal baptism, and each related to His death (Lk 12:50: &quot;I have a baptism to undergo&quot;; Mk 10:38: &quot;Are you able.. to be baptized with the baptism with which I am baptized?&quot;). (MacArthur)</span></p><p class="c2"><span>3:16: </span><span class="c0">Baptism </span><span>(</span><span class="c3">baptizo</span><span class="c4">) means literally &quot;to immerse&quot;: to dip and object into water or other liquid, not to have the liquid put on the object. The Christian church knew no form of baptism but immersion until the MIddle Ages, where the practice of sprinkling or pouring was introduced by the Roman Catholic church, which itself had previously always baptized by immersion. (MacArthur)</span></p><p class="c2"><span>3:16: That Jesus </span><span class="c0">went up immediately from the water</span><span>&nbsp;indicates that He had been all the way into the water. John was baptizing </span><span class="c3">in</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;the Jordan (v. 6), and his custom was to baptize where &quot;there was much water&quot; (Jn 3:23). (MacArthur)</span></p><p class="c2"><span>3:16: &quot;Just as the veil of the Temple was rent in twain to symbolize the perfect access of all men to God, so here he heavens are </span><span class="c0">rent asunder</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;to show how near God is to Jesus, and Jesus is to God.&quot; (MacArthur; quoting someone)</span></p><p class="c2"><span>3:16: To the Jewish mind of that day, the </span><span class="c0">dove</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;was associated with sacrifice. Bullocks were sacrificed by the rich, and lambs by the middle class, but most of the people were poor and could only afford a dove. (MacArthur)</span></p><p class="c2"><span>3:16: Why did the </span><span class="c0">Holy Spirit</span><span>&nbsp;come upon Jesus? When He became a man, Jesus did not lose His divinity. He was still fully God in every way. In His deity He needed nothing; but in His humanity He was here being anointed for service and granted strength for ministry. The Spirit anointed Him for His kingly service. &quot;The Spirit of the Lord God is upon me, because the Lord has </span><span class="c3">anointed</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;me to bring good news to the afflicted; He has sent me to bind up the brokenhearted, to proclaim liberty to captives, and freedom to prisoners&quot; (Is 61:1). The Spirit gave him strength, and empowered Him to to miracles (MacArthur).</span></p><p class="c2"><span>3:17: No OT sacrifice, no matter how carefully selected, had ever been truly pleasing to God, for no animal was perfect, and the blood of those animals was at best only symbolic, &quot;for it is impossible for the blood of bulls and goats to take away sins&quot; (Heb 10:4). But with Jesus God could say He was </span><span class="c0">well-pleased</span><span>. No imperfection could be found in Him, and God was delighted. (MacArthur)</span></p><h3 class="c7" id="h.u90zf5dcdc77"><span class="c11 c0">Chapter 4</span></h3><p class="c2"><span class="c4">4:1-11: One of the most monumental and mysterious spiritual battles of all time is recounted. The encounter occurred immediately after Jesus&#39; baptism and proved that He was worthy to receive and to reign over the Kingdom. His baptism declared His royalty; His testing demonstrated it. Jesus consistently lived in perfect harmony with the divine plan, and here He demonstrated His power over the prince of this world. (MacArthur)</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c4">4:1-11: In this struggle, we are given clear and applicable insights into satan&#39;s strategy against God and HIs people, and also into Christ&#39;s way of victory over the tempter.

A fifth-century Christian, Polemon (A. D. 450), wrote of his own personal struggle: &quot;Fly from all occasions of temptation, if still tempted fly further still; if there is no escape possible then have done with running away and show a bold face and take the two-edged sword of the Spirit. Some temptations must be taken by the throat, as David killed the lion; others must be stifled, as David hugged the bear to death. Some you had better keep to yourselves and don&#39;t give them air; shut them up as a scorpion in a bottle. Scorpions in such confinement die soon but if allowed out for a crawl and then put back into the bottle and corked down they will live a long while and give you trouble. Keep the cork on your temptations, and they&#39;ll die of themselves.&quot;. See also: Mt 5:29 (&quot;pluck the eye out&quot;).

temptation. Although temptations were given by satan, they were a part of God&#39;s perfect plan for the redemptive work of His Son. After thirty years of obscurity, Jesus was now in full consciousness of His divine mission. Then the devil tried to turn Him away: when we are most exhilarated with success, we are also most vulnerable to pride &mdash; and to failure. (MacArthur)</span></p><p class="c2"><span>4:1: </span><span class="c0">The wilderness</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;of Judea is a hot, barren, and desolate area that etends from the Dead Sea almost to Jerusalem, and is some 55km long and 25km wide. George Adam described it as &quot;an area of yellow sand and crumbling limestone. The hills are like dust heaps, the limestone is blistered and peeling, the rocks are bare and jagged&quot;. Nowhere in Palestine could Jesus have been more isolated or in less comfort.<br>Satan met adam in the paradise of Eden, where everything good was provided and nothing harmful existed. Adam lost his battle with satan while in the perfect situation. The Second Adam met satan in the desolate, forbidding wilderness, and won back. <br>What better proof can there be that spiritual and moral failure are not caused by circumstances but by the character and response of the one who is tempted? (MacArthur)</span></p><p class="c2"><span>4:1: &quot;</span><span class="c0">To be tested</span><span>&quot; (Gk. </span><span class="c3">peirazo</span><span>)</span><span>&nbsp;is a morally neutral word in Greek that simply means &quot;to test&quot;. Whether the testing is for a good or evil purpose depends on the intent of the one giving the test. The fact that </span><span class="c0">the devil</span><span>&nbsp;was doing the testing indicates that Jesus was being </span><span class="c0">tempted</span><span>, enticed to do evil. But God used satan&#39;s tempting to evil as His own means of testing for good: to demonstrate the Son&#39;s holiness and worthiness. <br>James 1:2-4 even tells us to &quot;consider it all joy&quot; when you encounter </span><span class="c3">testing</span><span class="c4">, because that is God&#39;s purpose &mdash; to use satan&#39;s temptations as a means of strengthening our faith and of our growing stronger in righteousness. God never tests in the sense of enticing to evil (Jas 1:13: &quot;let no one say, &#39;I am being tempted by God&#39;&quot;). God never has a part in that sort of testing, but He can and will turn even the worst sort of testing into the right sort, when it is surrendered to His will and power. It&#39;s God&#39;s great desire to turn into victory what satan intends for failure, to strengthen us at the very point where the adversary wants to find us weak.<br>(MacArthur)</span></p><p class="c2"><span>4:2: </span><span class="c0">Fasting fourty days</span><span class="c4">. Even in His perfect humanity, Jesus needed time for thought and for prayer, as we all do. (MacArthur)</span></p><p class="c2"><span>4:2: </span><span class="c0">Hungry</span><span class="c4">. Hunger not only makes us physically weak but also tends to weaken our moral and spiritual resistance as well. We are especially vulnerable to anything that might provide relief from our present distress. This is where satan usually attacks most fiercely. <br>Temptations that have been anticipated, guarded against, and prayed about, have little power to harm us (Mk 14:38: &quot;keep watching and praying, that you may not come into temptation&quot;). Victory over temptations comes from being constantly prepared for it, which, in turn, comes from constantly relying on the Lord. <br>It is said that a person travelling in tiger country will not be attached if he sees the tiger before the tiger sees him. Tigers attack from behind in order to surprise their victims, and therefore one of the best defenses against that vicious animal is to face it.<br>(MacArthur)</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c4">4:3-10: (v. 3) The first temptation was for Jesus to distrust the providential care of His Father and to use His own divine powers to serve Himself. (v. 5) The second temptation was for Jesus to presume on the Father&#39;s care by putting Him to the test. (v. 8) The third temptation was for Jesus to renounce the way of His Father and to substitute the way of Satan. (MacArthur)</span></p><p class="c2"><span>4:3: Mark and Luke seem to indicate that Jesus was </span><span class="c0">tempted</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;throughout His stay in the wilderness. (Mk 1:13; Lk 4:2). Possibly, it was the devil&#39;s strategy to gradually wear the Lord down little by little before confronting Him with the three great temptations that are specifically recorded. (MacArthur)</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c4">4:3: The first temptation was for Jesus to distrust the providential care of His Father and to use His own divine powers to serve Himself (MacArthur)</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c4">4:3: The devil&#39;s first approach to Jesus had also been his first approach to Eve: to case doubt on God&#39;s Word (Gen 3:1: &quot;indeed has God said..?&quot;). (MacArthur)</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c4">4:3: Satan was hoping to persuade Jesus to demonstrate His power to verify that it was real. That would mean violating God&#39;s plan that He set that power aside in humiliation and used it only when the Father willed. Satan wanted Jesus to disobey God. Affirming His deity and rights as the Son of God would have been to act independently of God. (MacArthur)</span></p><p class="c2"><span>4:3: The most obvious part of the temptation was for Jesus to fulfill His legitimate physical needs by miraculous means. But the deeper temptation was satan&#39;s appeal to Jesus&#39; supposed rights as the </span><span class="c0">Son of God</span><span class="c4">. &quot;Why would you starve, if you are really God&#39;s Son?&quot;. Jesus was tempted to doubt &nbsp;the Father&#39;s love and provision. He had every right, satan suggested, to use His own divine posers to supply what the Father had not. (MacArthur)</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c4">4:4: Jesus had come in His incarnation to do the Father&#39;s will. Indeed, His will and the Father&#39;s were exactly the same (Jn 4:34: &quot;My food is to do the will of Him&quot;). It was that absolute trust and submission that satan sought to shatter. To have succeeded would have put an irreparable rift in the Trinity. Satan tried to fracture the very nature of God Himself. (MacArthur)</span></p><p class="c2"><span>4:4: To every temptation, Jesus </span><span class="c0">answers</span><span>&nbsp;with </span><span class="c0">God</span><span class="c4">&#39;s Word. To be specific, with verses from Deuteronomy.</span></p><p class="c2"><span>4:4: Jesus declared that food is not the most important part of life, but the power of God is the only real source of man&#39;s existence. We are better off to obey and depend on </span><span class="c0">God</span><span class="c4">, waiting on His provision, than to impatiently and selfishly provide for ourselves in ways that disobey, or in any way compromise, His word. The central motive of our lives should be to please God and to trust Him to supply everything we need. If we live by faith in Him and in obedience to His Word, we will never lack anything we really need (Php 4:19: &quot;God shall supply all your needs&quot;; Mt 6:8: &quot;knows before we ask&quot;; Mt 6:33: &quot;seek first His kingdom&quot;). (MacArthur)</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c4">4:5: The second temptation was for Jesus to presume on the Father&#39;s care by putting Him to the test (MacArthur)</span></p><p class="c2"><span>4:5: Josephus reports that the drop from </span><span class="c0">the pinnacle</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;to the valley floor was some 137 meters. That&#39;s 41 stories. (MacArthur)</span></p><p class="c2"><span>4:5: According to early tradition, James, the head of the Jerusalem church and the brother of Jesus, was martyred by being thrown from that portico that this very </span><span class="c0">pinnacle</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;crowned. (MacArthur) </span></p><p class="c2"><span>4:5: The devil was saying: &quot;Prove to yourself and to the world that you are</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;the Son of God</span><span>. If You won&#39;t use your </span><span class="c3">own</span><span>&nbsp;divine power to help yourself, let your Father use </span><span class="c3">His</span><span>&nbsp;divine power to help you.</span><span class="c4">&quot;. In the eyes of many Jews, such an act would have been a sure proof of His messiahship. <br>According to William Barclay, that is exactly the sort of proof many purported messiahs of that day were trying to give: a man named Theudas promised to split the waters of Jordan; an Egyptian claimed he would lay flat the walls of Jerusalem; Simon the magician (from Act 8:9) tried the very feat with which satan tempted Jesus: jumping off the top of the Temple. All of them have failed and lost their following.<br>Sensationalism has always appealed to the flesh, but Jesus warned that false prophets would &quot;show great signs and wonders&quot; (Mt 24:24), but such signs do not produce faith. Even when they are from God, they only strengthen the faith of those who already believe. Demanding sensational proof is not evidence of faith but of doubt; it is masked unbelief. For those who believe in God, it is more than evident that He already has proved Himself.<br>(MacArthur)</span></p><p class="c2"><span>4:7: No matter how noble and important we may think our reasons are, to </span><span class="c0">test God</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;is to doubt God. And to doubt God is not to trust Him, and not to trust Him is sin. Satan tried to induce Jesus to sin, which would shatter His perfect holiness and separate Him from the Father. (MacArthur)</span></p><p class="c2"><span>4:7: To live recklessly and carelessly, and then expecting God to bail us out when we get in trouble, is to presume upon His grace. Those who willingly put themselves in the way of danger and temptation often end up blaming God when harm comes from their foolishness. When the Lord confronted Adam, he blamed God: &quot;the woman </span><span class="c3">whom You gave</span><span class="c4">&quot; (Gen 3:12).<br>When we risk our prestige, money, lives, families, or anything else to fulfill the Lord&#39;s calling, we can rest confidently in His divine provision. But when we take risks simply to fulfill our own ambitions, He gives no promise on which we can rest. (MacArthur)</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c4">4:8: The third temptation was for Jesus to renounce the way of His Father and to substitute the way of Satan. (MacArthur)</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c4">4:9: The devil tried to appeal to the &quot;lust of the eyes&quot; when he showed Jesus the kingdoms and suggested that He can immediately have them all, rather than experience the hard way of the Cross (John Strohman)</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c4">4:9: Satan now drops all pretense and reveals his supreme purpose: to induce Jesus to worship him. He first suggested what Jesus ought to do for Himself. Next he suggested what the Father ought to do for Jesus. Now he suggests what satan could do for Jesus &mdash; in exchange for what Jesus could do for him. (MacArthur)</span></p><p class="c2"><span>4:8: By some supernatural accommodation the devil showed Jesus the glories of Egypt &mdash; it pyramids, temples, libraries, and vast treasures. He showed the power and splendor of Rome, with its mighty empire spread over the known world. He showed great Athens, magnificent Corinth, and of course wondrous Jerusalem, the royal city of David. And as Jesus had a divine right to all </span><span class="c0">kingdoms</span><span class="c4">, satan appealed to that right in this last temptation. &quot;Why wait and suffer for what is already rightfully yours? Why submit as a Servant when you could reign as a King? I am only offering you what the Father has already promised.&quot;. But what the Father has promised to the Son because of His righteous obedience, satan offered on his own corrupt terms: in exchange for His unrighteous disobedience. <br>Satan always comes at us in that way. All we must do to get those things of the world is to go after them in the way of the world, which is satan&#39;s way. When we set out hearts on money, prestige, popularity, power, or selfish happiness, we are doing exactly what satan wanted Jesus to do: put self first and God last. Self-will is satan&#39;s will, and is therefore the opposite of God&#39;s will, which is for us to &quot;seek first His kingdom and His righteousness&quot; (Mt 6:33). <br>Satan is a counterfeiter: he offers what seems to be the same as what God offers, but easier. &quot;Just cut a corner here and there, turn your head a little at questionable practices, give in when it&#39;s advantageous, don&#39;t be a prude, follow the crowd. That&#39;s the way to success&quot;. The basic argument is always a form of the idea that the end justifies the means.<br>But satan is also the father of lies. His price is always immeasurably more than he leads us to believe. And what he gives is always immeasurably less than he promises. For Jesus to have given in to any of these temptations would have brought the same ultimate result: to be disqualified Himself both as King and as Savior. The statement of those who mocked at the foot of the cross would have had to have been reversed: &quot;He saved Himself; others He cannot save&quot; (Mt 27:42). Instead of redeeming the world, He would have joined the world.<br>(MacArthur)</span></p><p class="c2"><span>4:10: Satan tempted </span><span class="c0">Jesus</span><span>&nbsp;to misuse His power, but instead Jesus used the very same power to command </span><span>satan</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;to leave. Because satan&#39;s present power is only by God&#39;s permission, he had no choice but to obey and to leave until &quot;an opportune time&quot; (Lk 4:13). (MacArthur)</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c4">4:10: The Lord gives all of His children the power to resist satan (Jas 4:7: &quot;resist the devil, and he will free from you&quot;). For every temptation satan leads us into, a way out is provided by the Father (1 Cor 10:13: &ldquo;will provide a w&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ay of escape&rdquo;). (MacArthur)</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c4">4:11: Satan&rsquo;s temptations failed, but God&rsquo;s testings succeeded. He would trust the Father, He would not presume on His word, and He would not circumvent His will. The King was accredited by the severest test. (MacArthur)</span></p><p class="c2"><span>4:12: </span><span class="c0">John</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;was a bridge between the OT and the NT. During that first year of Jesus&rsquo; ministry, their two ministries overlapped. As John&rsquo;s work began to phase out, Jesus&rsquo; work began to build. (Jn 3:30: &ldquo;He must increase, but I must decrease&rdquo;). (MacArthur)</span></p><p class="c2"><span>4:12: We learn from John that about a year elapsed between Jesus&rsquo; wilderness temptations and the events recorded here: Him </span><span class="c0">withdrawing to Galilee</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;and beginning to preach there. During that time: John testified to Jesus&rsquo; messiahship (Jn 1:29: &ldquo;takes away the sin of the world&rdquo;; Jn 1:34: &ldquo;the SOn of God&rdquo;); two disciples of John left him to follow Jesus (Jn 1:35-37). Other highlights of that year: first miracle at the wedding at Cana (Jn 2:1-11); His cleansing of the Temple (2:12-25); His testimony to Nicodemus (3:1-21); the final public testimony of John the Baptist (3:22-36); Jesus&rsquo; ministry in Samaria at Sychar (4:1-42). (MacArthur)</span></p><p class="c2"><span>4:12: Jesus&rsquo; official ministry began when </span><span class="c0">John</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;went to jail. This was according to His Father&rsquo;s diving timetable (Gal 4:4: &ldquo;when the fullness of the time came&rdquo;; Jn 2:4: &ldquo;My hour has not yet come&rdquo;). (MacArthur)</span></p><p class="c2"><span>4:12: Matthew does not explain John&rsquo;s </span><span class="c0">arrest</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;until 14:3-12</span></p><p class="c2"><span>4:12: Even though </span><span class="c0">withdrew</span><span>&nbsp;(Gk. anachoreo) is often used to convey the thought of escaping danger, Jesus had no fear of Herod. Had He wanted to escape possible trouble from Herod, He would not have gone to </span><span class="c0">Galilee</span><span class="c4">, because that, too, was under Herod&rsquo;s control.<br>In John, we find that Jesus left Judea because &ldquo;the Pharisees had heard that Jesus was making and baptizing more disciples than John&rdquo; (Jn 4:1-3). Though the Pharisees had come to hate John, they dared not take action; even several years later they would not speak ill of him for &ldquo;fear of the multitude&rdquo; (Mt 21:26). They were greatly pleased, however, when Herod did what they themselves wanted, but were afraid, to do. When they learned that Jesus was gaining a larger following even than John, their hatred would soon turn against Him as well. <br>Jesus had no fear of Herod nor of the Pharisees, but He wanted to avoid a premature confrontation. It was not yet time for that hatred to be unleashed against Him.<br>(MacArthur)</span></p><p class="c2"><span>4:12: The Roman region of </span><span class="c0">Galillee</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;was heavily populated; estimated by some to have had as many as two million people in Jesus&rsquo; day. It had long been the breadbasket of central Palestine: the soil was extremely fertile, and the lake furnished great quantities of edible fish. Galileans were less traditional than the people of Jerusalem; perhaps Jesus chose His disciples from that area because they would be less bound to Jewish tradition and more open to the newness of the gospel. (MacArthur)</span></p><p class="c2"><span>4:13: Jesus&rsquo; hometown </span><span class="c0">Nazareth</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;rejected him (Lk 4:16-30: &ldquo;He went to the synagogue&rdquo;, read &ldquo;the scroll of the prophet Isaiah&rdquo;, but they doubted Him (&ldquo;is not this Joseph&rsquo;s son?&rdquo;) and wanted to &ldquo;throw Him down the cliff&rdquo;). (MacArthur)</span></p><p class="c2"><span>4:13: </span><span class="c0">Capernaum</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;(village of Nahum (=compassion)) would become Jesus&rsquo; new hometown (Mt 9:1: &ldquo;His city&rdquo;). It was a flourishing, prosperous city. Today, though a popular attraction for Christian visitors, it is virtually uninhabited (Mt 11:23-24: &ldquo;will you be exalted? you shall descend to Hades!&rdquo;). (MacArthur)</span></p><p class="c2"><span>4:15: </span><span class="c0">Galilee</span><span>&nbsp;was more of a crossroads than Jerusalem, which was isolated from much trade traffic. A famous trade route was actually known as Via Maris (</span><span class="c0">the way of the sea</span><span>. </span><span class="c1 c6"><a class="c8" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Via_Maris&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1582399365364000">Wiki: Via Maris</a></span><span class="c4">) and ran through Galilee from Damascus to the Mediterranean. One ancient writer even said that Judea was on the way to nowhere, whereas Galilee was on the way to everywhere. (MacArthur)</span></p><p class="c2"><span>4:15: Located on a trade route, </span><span class="c0">Galilean</span><span>&nbsp;Jews had constant association with </span><span class="c0">Gentiles</span><span class="c4">, which contributed greatly to their nontraditional character (MacArthur)</span></p><p class="c2"><span>4:15: The region of </span><span class="c0">Galilee</span><span>&nbsp;originally had been given to the tribes of Asher, </span><span class="c0">Zebulun and Naphtali</span><span>, but contrary to God&rsquo;s command, they failed to expel all of the Canaanites, and as a result, those unfaithful Jews suffered the problem of mixed marriages and the inevitable pagan influence which that practice brought. Under the Assyrian rule (XII BC &ndash; I BC), it was largely populated by </span><span class="c0">Gentiles</span><span>. Through those disrupting centuries, the Jews that remained in Galilee had been greatly weakened in both biblical and traditional Judaism. Hence the name, </span><span class="c0">Galilee of the Gentiles</span><span class="c4">.<br>It is not strange, then, that the reaction of many Jews in Jerusalem was, &ldquo;Surely the Christ is not going to come from Galilee, is He?&rdquo; (Jn 7:41). Yet this is what Isaiah 9:1-2 prophesied: the despised, sin-darkened, rebellious Galileans were the first to glimpse the Messiah. <br>Not the learned, proud, and pure Jews of Jerusalem, but the mongrel, downcast, nontraditional mixed multitude of Samaria and Galilee had that great honor. To those who were neediest, and ho were most likely to recognize their need, Jesus went first.<br>The fact that Jesus did not start with Judea emphasizes the fact that His gospel of salvation was for the whole world, and in no way an accommodation to the proud and exclusive Judaism that had developed during the intertestamental period. The Son of God was sent to be &ldquo;a light of revelation of the Gentiles, and the glory of Your people Israel&rdquo; (Lk 2:32).<br>(MacArthur)</span></p><p class="c2"><span>4:16: One of the most beautiful metaphors used to describe Jesus&rsquo; nature and character is that of </span><span class="c0">light</span><span>. It conveys the idea of the illuminating, truth-revealing, and sin-exposing ministry of the Son of God. John says: &ldquo;in Him was life, and the life was the light of men&rdquo; (Jn 1:4-5); John came to &ldquo;bear witness to the light&hellip; the true light which, coming into the world, enlightens every man&rdquo; (Jn 1:8-9); &ldquo;this is the judgment, that the light has come into the world, and men loved the darkness&rdquo; (Jn 3:19-21). In the OT, </span><span class="c3">walking in the light</span><span>&nbsp;was often used as a figure of righteousness and obedience to God. Now, Jesus presents Himself as the embodiment of righteousness and godliness. </span><span class="c4">&nbsp;(MacArthur)</span></p><p class="c2"><span>4:17: To </span><span class="c0">preach</span><span>&nbsp;(Gk. kerusso) means &ldquo;to proclaim&rdquo; or &ldquo;to publish&rdquo;, that is, to publicly make a message known. R. C. H. Lenski comments: &ldquo;The point to be noted is that </span><span class="c0">to preach</span><span>&nbsp;is not to argue, reason, dispute, or convince by intellectual proof, against all of which a keen intellect may bring counterargument. We simply state in public or testify to all men the truth which God bids us state. &hellip; Men eigher believe the truth, as all sane men should, or refuse to believe it, as only fools venture o do.&rdquo;. Jesus preached His message with certainty. He did not come to dispute or to argue, but to proclaim,</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;to preach</span><span class="c4">. Preaching is the proclamation of certainties, not the suggestion of possibilities.<br>Jesus also preached &ldquo;as one having authority, not as their scribes&rdquo; (Mt 7:29). For God&rsquo;s people once again to hear someone preach as the prophets had preached was astonishing.<br>Jesus preached only what He was commissioned by His Father to preach (Jn 3:34: &ldquo;for He whom God has sent speaks the words of God&rdquo;; Jn 12:49: &ldquo;For I have not spoken on my own authority&rdquo;).<br>(MacArthur)</span></p><p class="c2"><span>4:17: This verse summarizes the message that Jesus was preaching: </span><span class="c0">repentance</span><span>, and the coming of the </span><span class="c0">Kingdom of Heaven</span><span class="c4">. This is similar to John&#39;s message (3:2). It is necessary to repent in order to believe. The apostles, when Jesus sent them, also &ldquo;proclaimed that people should repent&rdquo; (Mk 6:12). Repentance was the conclusion of Peter&rsquo;s Pentecost sermon: &ldquo;repent, and let each of you be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ for the forgiveness of your sins&rdquo; (Ac 2:38). Many years later, Paul reminded Timothy that repentance leads &ldquo;to the knowledge of the truth&rdquo; (2 Tim 2:25).</span></p><p class="c2"><span>4:17: </span><span class="c0">Repent</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;(Gk. Metanoeite; same word John the Baptist had used) literally means a change of perception, a change in the way we see something. To repent, therefore, is to change the way a person looks at sin and the way he looks at righteousness. It involves a change of opinion, of direction, of life itself. To repent is to have a radical change of heart and will &mdash; and, consequently, of behavior (Mt 3:8: &ldquo;bear fruit in keeping with repentance&rdquo;). (MacArthur)</span></p><p class="c2"><span>4:17: Was this message new to Israel? </span><span class="c0">Repentance</span><span>, of course, had always been in order and had always been needed, but now that </span><span class="c0">the kingdom of heaven</span><span>&nbsp;was </span><span class="c0">at hand</span><span class="c4">, it was all the more imperative. Tragically, because most of Israel did not repent and did not recognize and accept the King, the promised earthly kingdom had to be postponed. As Matthew later explains, the literal, physical kingdom was set aside for a period of time. The spiritual kingdom presently exists only in the hearts of those who have trusted in Jesus Christ, the King. He is not ruling the nation Israel and the world as He one day will, but He rules the lives of those who belong to Him by faith. The world does not have peace, but those do who know the Prince of Peace. The external kingdom had not yet come, yet the King Himself indwells those that are His. (MacArthur)</span></p><p class="c2"><span>4:17: What did Puritans believe about </span><span class="c0">repentance</span><span>? &nbsp;Goodwin is representative of them. The British Puritan wrote this: &ldquo;Where </span><span class="c0">mourning</span><span class="c4">&rdquo; &ndash; that is, weeping &ndash; &ldquo;for offending God is wanting&rdquo; &ndash; or lacking &ndash; &ldquo;there is no sign of any good will yet wrought in the heart to God, nor of love to Him, without which God will never accept a man.&rdquo; &nbsp;In other words, he&rsquo;s saying if there&rsquo;s no mourning over sin it&rsquo;s evident God hasn&rsquo;t worked in the heart. &nbsp;&ldquo;Else there is no hope of amendment. &nbsp;God will not pardon till He sees hopes of amendment. &nbsp;Now until a man confesses his sin, and that with bitterness, it is a sign that he loves it. &nbsp;Whilst he hides it, spares it, and forsakes it not, it is sweet in his mouth, and therefore till he confess it and mourn for it, it is a sign it is not bitter to him, and so he will not forsake it. &nbsp;A man will never leave sin till he finds bitterness in it, and if so, then he will be in bitterness for it. &nbsp;And godly sorrow works repentance.&rdquo;<br>Of all the statements that I have read on the subject, the strongest one comes from Charles Haddon Spurgeon. &nbsp;Listen to what Spurgeon said. &nbsp;&ldquo;There must be a true and actual abandonment of sin and a turning unto righteousness in real act and deed in everyday life. &nbsp;Repentance, to be sure, must be entire. &nbsp;How many will say, &lsquo;Sir, I will renounce this sin and the other, but there are certain darling lusts which I must keep and hold?&rsquo; &nbsp;Oh, sirs, in God&rsquo;s name let me tell you, it is not the giving up of one sin, nor 50 sins, which is true repentance. &nbsp;It is the solemn renunciation of every sin. &nbsp;If thou dost harbor one of those accursed vipers in thy heart, and dost give up every other, that one lust, like one leak in a ship, will sink thy soul. &nbsp;Think it not sufficient to give up thy outward vices, fancy it not enough to cut off the more corrupt sins of thy life. &nbsp;It is all or none which God demands. &nbsp;&lsquo;Repent,&rsquo; says He, and when He bids you repent, He means repent of all thy sins, otherwise He can never accept thy repentance as real and genuine. &nbsp;All sin must be given up or else you will never have Christ. &nbsp;All transgression must be renounced or else the gates of heaven must be barred against you. &nbsp;Let us remember, then, that for repentance to be sincere, it must be entire repentance. &nbsp;True repentance is a turning of the heart as well as of the life. &nbsp;It is the giving up of the whole soul to God to be His forever and ever. &nbsp;It is the renunciation of the sins of the heart as well as the crimes of the life,&rdquo; end quote. &nbsp;Strong enough? <br>(MacArthur)</span></p><p class="c2"><span>4:17: </span><span class="c0">Repentance</span><span class="c4">. Thayer&rsquo;s Greek lexicon defines metanoe as, quote: &ldquo;The change of mind of those who have begun to abhor their errors and misdeeds, and have determined to enter upon a better course of life, so that it embraces both a recognition of sin, and sorrow for it, and hearty amendment, the tokens and effects of which are good deeds,&rdquo; end quote. &nbsp;In other words, it&rsquo;s a redirection of the will that results in a changed behavior. &nbsp;It&rsquo;s not merely sorrow for sin, although genuine repentance always has sorrow. &nbsp;It is a redirection of the human will. &nbsp;It is a choice to forsake all unrighteousness and pursue holiness. &nbsp;And please, beloved, it is that redirection of the will that is the work of God. &nbsp;We&rsquo;re not talking about something you do; we&rsquo;re talking about God doing something in you when He saves you. &nbsp;People say, &ldquo;Well, you&rsquo;re teaching that this is some pre-salvation work, and until you clean your life up and repent, you can&rsquo;t get saved.&rdquo; &nbsp;No, repentance is not a pre-salvation attempt to get your life cleaned up. &nbsp;It is not a call to stop sinning so you can get saved. &nbsp;Not at all. &nbsp;It is not just an invitation to turn your back on all evil so Christ will accept you. &nbsp;It is the thing which God produces in you when He saves you. &nbsp;It&rsquo;s an element of saving faith that redirects the will.<br>J.I. Packer, in his helpful little book, Evangelism and the Sovereignty of God, writes, &ldquo;The repentance that Christ requires of His people consists in a settled refusal to set any limit to the claims which He may make on their lives.&rdquo; &nbsp;It&rsquo;s not just a mental activity. &nbsp;There&rsquo;s an intellectual aspect, let me give you this quickly. &nbsp;There&rsquo;s an intellectual aspect. &nbsp;Repentance involves recognition of sin, recognition of the sinfulness of sin, recognition that sin affronts a holy God. &nbsp;It involves the intellectual recognition that I&rsquo;m personally responsible for my sin and my guilt. &nbsp;It includes the recognition that Christ died for my sin, and that He, as God, wants to rule my life. &nbsp;That&rsquo;s the intellectual part of repentance. &nbsp;Secondly, it has an emotional part. &nbsp;That recognition produces sorrow, it produces new desires and new impulses, it produces shame. And 2 Corinthians 7:10 says there is a sorrow that leads to repentance. &nbsp;So it starts out, you see that sin is sinful, you see that you are guilty, you see that Christ has provided intellectually, and then it touches your emotions, and there&rsquo;s a brokenness, and a sorrow, and a shame, and a guilt that pours out; and out of that sorrow comes the third element, and that is the volitional - the volitional. &nbsp;Finally, repentance enacts the will, and brings a change of direction, a new determination to abandon stubborn disobedience and surrender your life to Christ. &nbsp;And then it produces a changed behavior. &nbsp;Where there&rsquo;s no changed behavior, repentance may have been intellectual, and it may have been emotional, but it was never volitional. &nbsp;It redirects the will when it&rsquo;s genuine.<br>Thirdly, and as a result, it&rsquo;s life-changing. &nbsp;It&rsquo;s life-changing. &nbsp;It&rsquo;s an element of saving faith, it activates the will, redirects it, and it&rsquo;s life-changing. &nbsp;That&rsquo;s why John said, &ldquo;Bring forth fruit meet for repentance.&rdquo; &nbsp;You say you repent; let&rsquo;s see your life. &nbsp;Demonstrate it. &nbsp;Real repentance alters the character of a person. &nbsp;One of my heroes, the men that I esteem highly, is Martyn Lloyd-Jones. &nbsp;One of the books that&rsquo;s blessed me that he wrote has to do with the Sermon on the Mount. &nbsp;In it, he writes this &ndash; he&rsquo;s now with the Lord &ndash; &ldquo;Repentance means that you realize that you are a guilty, vile sinner in the presence of God, that you deserve the wrath and punishment of God, that you are hell-bound. &nbsp;It means that you begin to realize that this thing called sin is in you, and that you long to get rid of it, and that you turn your back on it in every shape and form. &nbsp;You renounce the world, whatever the cost, the world in its mind and outlook, as well as its practices, and you deny yourself and take up the cross, and go after Christ. &nbsp;Your nearest and dearest, and the whole world, may call you a fool, or say you have religious mania; you may have to suffer financially, but it makes no difference. &nbsp;That is repentance.&rdquo;<br>(MacArthur)</span></p><p class="c2"><span>4:18: They </span><span class="c0">cast the net</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;from the shallow water along the shore; to use a large dragnet in the deep water, they&rsquo;d have to use two or more boats. The net therefore was about 3 meters in diameter. (MacArthur) </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c4">4:19: God always chooses Himself partners: Noah, Abraham, Moses and David. He chose Israel herself to be a whole nation of priests. Here, Jesus calls fishermen to evangelism: the called ones are themselves to become callers. (MacArthur)</span></p><p class="c2"><span>4:19: Jesus promised to </span><span class="c0">make</span><span>&nbsp;them </span><span class="c0">fishers of men</span><span class="c4">. As He later would make clear, they could never be effective disciples in any way without His power (Jn 15:5: &ldquo;apart from me you can do nothing&rdquo;). <br>Moreover, He trained them. First, by sending the disciples out two-by-two on brief missions. After three years of teaching and training He finally left them permanently &mdash; but with the paraclete.<br>(MacArthur)</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c4">4:19: A number of qualities that make a good fisherman can also help make a good evangelist. 1) Be patient: it often takes time to find a school of fish; 2) have perseverance: not just wait, but go from place to place over and over &mdash; until the fish are found; 3) good instinct for the right time: poor timing has lost many a catch; 4) courage: readiness to face considerable danger from storms and various mishaps. 5) knowing when to get out of sight: getting in the way of our witnessing may cause people to turn away. A good soul-winner keeps himself out of the picture as much as possible. (MacArthur)</span></p><p class="c2"><span>4:20: &ldquo;</span><span class="c0">Followed</span><span class="c4">&rdquo; conveys the idea of following as a disciple who is committed to imitating the one he follows. (MacArthur) </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c4">4:20: This is not the first time that Peter meets Jesus; the first encounter had happened before, in Jn 1:41 (Andrew finds his brother, Peter, and says: &ldquo;We have found the Messiah&rdquo;). In a parallel episode in Lk 5:1-11 Peter even lets Jesus enter his boat to preach, and then obeys His word to cast the nets. Thus, Peter&#39;s decision is not to follow a complete stranger, but Someone he had known. (me)<br>Still, they had little knowledge of Jesus&rsquo; teaching or of what following Him would cost. But it was enough for them to know who He was and that His call to them was a divine call. (MacArthur)</span></p><p class="c2"><span>4:20: The disciples&rsquo; obedience was instant: </span><span class="c0">they immediately left the nets and followed Him.</span><span>&nbsp;The sovereign authority of the Lord has spoken. (MacArthur)</span><span class="c17 c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c4">4:21: These three, James, Peter and John, were later esteemed &ldquo;pillars&rdquo; among the apostles (Gal 2:9)</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c4">4:21: The disciple had little education and little spiritual perception. They did not understand the parables. They rebuked those who brought children to Jesus (Mt 19:13). They slept in Gethsemane (Mt 26:40,45). Peter rebuked Jesus (Mt 16:22). They argued who was the greatest (Mk 9:34). Peter denied Jesus (M 26:33-35). All disciples deserted Jesus on the cross (Mt 26:56). At the time of their calling, the disciples were selfish, proud, weak, and cowardly. They showed little potential even for dependability, much less for greatness. Yet Jesus chose them for disciples, even to be His inner circle of twelve. They were raw material that He would make into useful instruments. (MacArthur)</span></p><p class="c2"><span>4:21: All the disciples were probably not as rough and unpromising as the pillars, but </span><span class="c3">not one was chosen from among the Jewish religious leaders</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;(!). It was no doubt partly that fact that caused those leaders to reject Jesus. It was beyond their comprehension that the Messiah would bypass the proper leaders of His chosen people when He came to establish His kingdom.<br>The only apostle who had been a Jewish religious leader was not among the original twelve, and he considered himself &ldquo;one untimely born&rdquo;. He knew that his own calling was exceptional and reflected God&rsquo;s exceeding grace (1 Cor 15:8-10: &ldquo;untimely born&rdquo;, &ldquo;unworthy&rdquo;, &ldquo;by the grace&rdquo;).<br>He reminded the Corinthian believers, &ldquo;For consider your calling, brothers: not many of you were wise according to worldly standards, not many were powerful, not many were of noble birth. But God chose what is foolish in the world to shame the wise; &hellip; so Let the one who boasts, boast in the Lord&rdquo;. (1 Cor 1:26-29).<br>(MacArthur)</span></p><p class="c2"><span>4:23: Matthew introduces Jesus&rsquo; ministry of </span><span class="c0">teaching</span><span>, preaching and </span><span class="c0">healing</span><span class="c4">. (MacArthur)</span></p><p class="c2"><span>4:23: Travelling </span><span class="c0">throughout Galilee</span><span class="c4">, He ministered to as many people as He possibly could. He did not have to visit every village: because the entire region was only 100km&times;50km, anyone interested in seeing and hearing Him would not have had far to travel. (MacArthur)</span></p><p class="c2"><span>4:23: By NT times, </span><span class="c0">synagogues</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;had become the most important institution in Jewish life. Many Jews lived thousands of miles from Jerusalem&rsquo;s Temple and could never expect to visit there. The synagogue is believed to have developed during the Babylonian exile. <br>It was not only the primary place of worship, but also of study, community fellowship, and of legal activity. The greatest tragedy for most Jews was to be disfellowshipped from the synagogue. This is what happened to Jews who became Christians, and this is the reason many Jews refused to.<br>Worship was held of Sabbaths (starting friday evening): sections of Torah were read and expounded. Often visiting dignitaries or rabbis would be given the honor of expounding the Scripture: a practice of which Jesus and Paul took advantage on numerous occasions.<br>Ten elders usually administered a synagogue, of whom 3 were called &ldquo;rulers&rdquo;. One elder interpreted the Scripture into the vernacular, one headed the theological school, and one teaching people. During Roman rule, the synagogue officials had the power to settle virtually every legal dispute within their congregations and even to inflict punishment (with the exception of execution).<br>The synagogue served as a public school for boys, where they studied the Talmud and learned to read, write, and to do basic arithmetic. For men, it was a place of advanced theological study.<br>(MacArthur)</span></p><p class="c2"><span>4:23: It was in the </span><span class="c0">synagogues</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;that believing, sincere Israelites would be found, and here, if anywhere, Jesus could expect to find those who would hear and accept His divine message. As a travelling rabbi, Jesus was welcomed in most of them in the early part of His ministry. (MacArthur)</span></p><p class="c2"><span>4:23: </span><span class="c0">Teaching</span><span>&nbsp;(Gk. </span><span class="c3">didaskon</span><span class="c4">) focused on content, with the purpose of discovering the truth &mdash; contrary to the forums so popular among Greeks, where discussion and the bantering about of various ideas and opinions was the primary concern. (MacArthur) </span></p><p class="c2"><span>4:23: </span><span class="c0">Proclaiming</span><span>&nbsp;(Gk. </span><span class="c3">kerusson</span><span>), relates simply to announcing a message, unlike &ldquo;teaching&rdquo;,</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;which relates to explaining it. The message proclaimed needs to be explained, and vise versa. (MacArhur)</span></p><p class="c2"><span>4:23: </span><span class="c0">Gospel</span><span>&nbsp;means &ldquo;good news&rdquo;: the good news that the </span><span class="c0">kingdom</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;was coming. Around this supreme truth all of His teaching centered. (MacArthur)</span></p><p class="c2"><span>4:23: Miracles of </span><span class="c0">healing</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;was one of the ways Jesus demonstrated His divine character, His mesianic credentials. Jesus&rsquo; healing was a divine verification: His words should have been sufficient evidence of His missiahship, as they were for those who truly believed (Lk 4:22,32: people wondering and amazed at Jesus&rsquo; words and authority); but it was also a powerful addition to His teaching and preaching. The miracles are also &ldquo;an illustration of the nature of His kingdom; they were His first gifts to His kingdom subjects&rdquo; (Alexander Maclaren). They were a foretaste of His glorious, earthly kingdom. To gen some idea of what the millenial kingdom will be like, we need only multiply His words and His miracles ten-thousandfold. (MacArthur)</span></p><p class="c2"><span>4:24: The verse expands the universal character of the healings. </span><span class="c0">Demons</span><span>, </span><span class="c0">seizures</span><span>, </span><span class="c0">paralytics</span><span>&nbsp;characterize the three broad areas of man&rsquo;s afflictions: the spiritual, the mental, and the physical. Jesus was able to overpower whatever evil affected those who came to Him,</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;and He healed them</span><span class="c4">. (MacArthur)</span></p><p class="c2"><span>4:24: </span><span class="c0">Syria</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;was a Roman province that took in all of Palestine, including Galilee; but here Syria refers only to its northern part. In any case, the point is that Jesus&rsquo; fame spread well beyond the area in which He was ministering. (MacArthur)</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c4">4:24: &ldquo;When our Lord came down to earth, He drew heaven with Him. The signs which accompanied His ministry were but the trailing clouds of glory which He brought from heaven, which is His home. [...] It has been said that in effect He banished disease and death from Palestine for three years of His ministry. One touch of the hem of His garment that He wore could heal whole countries of their pain. One touch of His hand could restore life.&rdquo; (B.B. Warfield)</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c4">4:24: Jesus&rsquo; miracles accomplished four things above and beyond the immediate and obvious benefit to those who were healed. 1) they proved that He was divine, because no mere human could do such things; 2) showed that God is compassionate toward those who suffer; 3) showed that Jesus was the prophesied Messiah; 4) proved that the coming kingdom was a reality. (MacArthur)</span></p><p class="c2"><span>4:24: Six features of Jesus&rsquo; </span><span class="c0">healing</span><span class="c4">: 1) Jesus healed directly, with a word or touch, without prayer; 2) Jesus healed instantaneously; 3) He healed completely; 4) He healed everyone who came to Him, everyone who was brought to Him, and everyone for whom healing was asked by another, &mdash; with no discrimination as to person or affliction; 5) Jesus healed organic and congenital problems, no matter how severe and longstanding; 6) He healed even after disease had run its full course and taken the life of the victim. He brought people back to life.

It beautifully and powerfully flows from the introduction (5:3-12) to the first point (the citizens of the kingdom, 5:13-16), to the second point (the righteousness of the kingdom, 5:17-7:12), to the third point (the exhortation to enter the kingdom, 7:13-27), and to the conclusion (the effect of the sermon on its hearers, 7:28-29). The transitions from point to point are clear and unmistakable. (MacArthur)</span></p><p class="c2"><span>5:1: A rabbi commonly </span><span class="c0">sat down</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;when he taught. If he spoke while standing or walking, what he said was considered to be informal and unofficial. But when he sat down, what he said was authoritative and official. (MacArthur)</span></p><p class="c2 c10"><span class="c4"></span></p><h4 class="c25" id="h.wq7qlbeq8jt3"><span>The Beatitudes</span></h4><p class="c2"><span class="c4">5:2: Until this point, Jesus&rsquo; words have been limited; now, in one powerfully comprehensive yet compact message, the Lord sets forth the foundational truths of the gospel of the kingdom He came to proclaim. (MacArthur)</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c4">5:2: This teaching is the upside-down version of the world. Our world thinks very highly of wealth, pride, personal power, and the &quot;winner-take-all&quot; mentality. But the kingdom of God is the exact opposite. (John Strohman)</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c4">5:2: The ideals and principles in the Sermon on the Mount are utterly contrary to those of human societies and governments. In Christ&#39;s kingdom the most exalted persons are those who are the lowliest in the world&#39;s estimation. They are characterized in this sermon as being humble, compassionate, meek, yearning for righteousness, merciful, pure in heart, peacemakers, and persecuted for the sake of the very righteousness they practice. In the world&#39;s eyes those characteristics are the marks of losers. <br>But this standard of living counters everything the world practices and holds dear. <br>To live by the standards He gives here is to live a life of blessed happiness: one that results in joy instead of despair, in peace instead of conflict &mdash; a peace that the world does not understand and cannot have (Jn 14:27: &ldquo;not as the world gives&rdquo;; Php 4:7: &ldquo;surpasses all understanding&rdquo;). It is a blessedness not produced by the world or by circumstances, and it cannot be taken away by the world or by circumstances. It is not produced externally and cannot be destroyed externally.<br>(MacArthur)</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c4">5:2: The thrust of the Sermon of the Moung is that the message and work of the King are first and most importantly internal and not external, and spiritual and moral rather than physical and political. His concern is for what men are, because what they are determines what they do. (MacArthur)</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c4">5:2: His principles cannot work for those who do not have a transformed nature and God&#39;s indwelling power. These are the standards which unglorified human strength cannot continually achieve. One cannot behave like Christ until one becomes like Christ.<br>The blessedness Christ offers is not dependent on self-effort or self-righteousness, but on the new nature God gives. In God&rsquo;s Son, man comes to share God&rsquo;s very nature, which is characterized by true righteousness and its consequence &mdash; blessedness, or happiness. (MacArthur)</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c4">5:2: Jesus&rsquo; new way of living comes from a new way of thinking, and the new way of thinking comes from new life. Those who do not follow them as a general direction of life have an unacceptable righteousness (Mt 5:20: &ldquo;For I tell you, unless your righteousness exceeds that of the scribes and Pharisees, you will never enter the kingdom of heaven.&rdquo;).<br>As the Sermon on the Mount itself makes clear, internal changes also bring external changes. When our attitudes and thinking are right, our actions will fall in line. If our inner life does not make our outer life better, our inner life is deficient or nonexistent. (Jas 2:20: &ldquo;faith without works is useless&rdquo;). The true outside life can only be produced from a true inside life.<br>To claim to follow the spirit without obeying the letter is to be a liar. To follow the letter without following the spirit is to be a hypocrite. To follow the spirit in the right attitude and the letter in the right action is to be a faithful child of God and a loyal subject of the King.<br>(MacArthur)</span></p><p class="c2"><span>5:2: (</span><span class="c1">On the religious climate</span><span class="c4">) The Pharisees believed that right religion consisted in divine laws and religious regulations. They focused on adhering to the laws of the past.<br>The Sadducees focused on the present. They were the religious liberals who discounted most things supernatural and who modified both Scripture and tradition to fit their own religious philosophy.<br>The Essenes were ascetics who believed that right religion meant separation from the rest of society. They led austere lives in remote, barren areas such as Qumran.<br>The Zealots were fanatical nationalists who thought that right religion centered in radical political activism. These Jewish revolutionaries looked down on fellow Jews who would not take up arms against Rome.<br>In essence, the Pharisees said, &ldquo;Go back&rdquo;; the Sadducees said, &ldquo;Go ahead&rdquo;; The Essenes said, &ldquo;Go away&rdquo;; and the Zealots said, &ldquo;Go against&rdquo;. The Pharisees were traditionalists; the Sadducees were modernists; the Essenes were separatists; the Zealots were activists. They represented the same primary types of religious factions that are common today.<br>But Jesus&rsquo; way was not any of those. To the Pharisees He said that true spirituality is internal, not external. To the Sadducees He said that it is God&rsquo;s way, not man&rsquo;s way. To the Essenes He said that it is a matter of the heart, not the body. To the Zealots He said that it is a matter of worship, not revolution. The way of His kingdom is first and above all a matter of the inside: the soul. That is the central focus of the Sermon on the Mount. True religion in God&rsquo;s kingdom is the right attitude toward God and toward other people.<br>(MacArthur)</span></p><p class="c2"><span>5:2: Everything Jesus said </span><span class="c0">to the multitudes</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;was spoken publicly, with the intention to drive them to a recognition of their sin, and thus to the need of a Savior. Until they believed in Him, the demands of the sermon could only show them how terribly far they were from meeting God&rsquo;s standards. (MacArthur)</span></p><p class="c2"><span>5:2: When </span><span class="c0">He taught</span><span class="c4">, He quoted no sources, no ancient rabbis, no revered tradition. What He spoke, He spoke on His own authority. That was unheard of among the Jews, who always derived their authorty from recognized sources. Yet when Jesus concluded, &ldquo;the multitudes were amazed at His teaching; for He was teaching them as one having authority, and not as their scribes&rdquo; (Mt 7:28-29). (MacArthur)</span></p><p class="c2"><span>5:2: &ldquo;</span><span class="c0">opened His mouth</span><span class="c4">&rdquo; was a common colloquialism used to introduce a message that was especially solemn and important. It was also used to indicate intimate, heartfelt, testimony or sharing.

Jesus presents the possibility of people being genuinely happy. Happiness that is available is a fitting start for the New Testament&rsquo;s &ldquo;good news&rdquo;. <br>Far from being the cosmic killjoy that many accuse Him of being, God desires to save men from their tragic lostness, to give them power to obey His will, and to make them happy. This sermon sets the way of blessedness for those who come to Him.<br>The word </span><span class="c0">blessed (</span><span>Gk. </span><span class="c3">Makarios</span><span>)</span><span>&nbsp;means happy, fortunate, blissful. Is used here to describe the state of inward contentedness that is not affected by circumstances but is based on having one&rsquo;s life right with God. <br>Blessedness is a characteristic of God, and it can be a characteristic of men only as they share in the nature of God. It becomes clear that Jesus is speaking of a reality that is only available for believers. <br>It is important to remember that the Beatitudes are pronouncements, not probabilities. Men are not </span><span class="c3">more likely</span><span>&nbsp;to be happy if they have these qualities; they are certain divine judgmental pronouncements.</span><span class="c4"><br>(MacArthur)</span></p><p class="c2"><span>5:3-12: (</span><span class="c1">vs the world</span><span>) The Beatitudes seem paradoxical. By normal human standards such things as humility, mourning, desire for righteousness, mercy, and persecution are not the stuff of which happiness is made. To the natural man, and to the immature or carnal Christian, such happiness sounds like misery with another name. And in a way, it is misery. Jesus teaches that misery endured for the right purpose and in the right way </span><span class="c3">is</span><span>&nbsp;the key to happiness. <br>The philosophy of the world is: </span><span class="c3">things satisfy</span><span class="c4">. Acquiring things brings happiness, achieving things brings meaning, doing things brings satisfaction. Solomon tried the world&rsquo;s way to happiness for many years and had plenty of wealth, wisdom, and power, yet he concluded that his life was purposeless and empty. &ldquo;All is vanity.&rdquo; (Ecclesiastes)<br>The tree of happiness cannot grow in a cursed earth. Earthly things cannot bring even lasting earthly happiness, much less eternal happiness. Physical things simply cannot touch the soul, &ldquo;for one&#39;s life does not consist in the abundance of his possessions&rdquo; (Lk 12:15).<br>(The opposite is also true: spiritual things cannot satisfy physical needs. When someone is hungry he needs food, not a lecture on grace. When he is hurt, he needs medical attention, not moral advice.)<br>Jesus didn&rsquo;t teach that claiming faithfulness to Christ guarantees health, wealth, success, prestige and prosperity. Instead, He warned that physical, worldly advantages most often limit true happiness: they become fuel for pride, lust, and self-satisfaction &mdash; the enemies not only of righteousness, but also of happiness.<br>True blessedness is on a higher level than anything in the world. Here is a completely new way of life, based on a completely new way of thinking. It is in fact based on a new way of being. This standard of righteousness it the standard of selflessness: a standard that is completely opposite to man&rsquo;s fallen impulses and unregenerate nature. It is impossible to follow Jesus&rsquo; new way of living without having His new life within.<br>(MacArthur)</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c4">5:3-12: The Beatitudes are not in random order, but lead to the other in logical succession: being poor in spirit reflects the right attitude we should have to our spiritual condition, which then should lead us to mourn, to be meek and gentle, to hunger and thirst for righteousness, to be merciful, pure in heart, and have a peacemaking spirit.

The term did not mean simply poor, but begging poor. As he held out one hand for alms, he often hid his face with the other hand, ashamed of being recognized.<br>Poor people were commonly called &ldquo;</span><span class="c3">penichros</span><span>&rdquo;, as the widow Jesus saw in the Temple: poor, but not a beggar. </span><span class="c3">Penichros</span><span>&nbsp;poor has at least some meager resources; </span><span class="c3">ptochos</span><span>&nbsp;poor is completely dependent on others for sustenance, with absolutely no means of self-support.<br>Some interpreters have maintained that v.3 teaches material poverty, but Jesus is speaking of a spiritual poverty that corresponds to the material poverty. Matthew makes clear that Jesus is talking about the condition of the </span><span class="c0">spirit</span><span>, not of the wallet.<br>The </span><span class="c0">poor in spirit</span><span>&nbsp;are those who recognize their total spiritual destitution and their complete dependence on God. They perceive that there are no saving resources in themselves and that they can only beg for mercy and grace.<br>(Examples: In the parable of the tax-collector and the Pharisee praying (Lk 18:9-14), the Pharisee was proud in spirit, but the tax-collector was </span><span class="c0">poor in spirit</span><span class="c4">. Paul recognized that &ldquo;nothing good dwells in me, that is, in my flesh&rdquo; (Rom 7:18))<br>The error of the Pharisees: in the name of interpreting and protecting the law, they contradicted and weakened it. They brought God&rsquo;s standards down to men&rsquo;s standards, which they could keep without God&rsquo;s help. They made the fatal error of thinking that God was less holy than He is and that they were more holy than they were. The result was the illusion that they were sufficiently righteous to please God. But the humble and penitent still called to God for help.<br>(MacArthur)</span></p><p class="c2"><span>5:3: </span><span class="c1">(Why Humility is First</span><span>) Jesus puts this beatitude first because humility is the foundation of all other graces, a basic element in becoming a Christian. Pride has no part in Christ&rsquo;s kingdom, and until a person surrenders pride, he cannot enter the kingdom. The door into His kingdom is low, and no one who stands tall will ever go through it. We cannot be filled until we are empty; we cannot be made worthy until we recognize our unworthiness; we cannot live until we admit we are dead. We might as well expect fruit to grow without a tree as to expect the other graces of the Christian life to grow without humility.<br>Until a soul is humbled, until the inner person is </span><span class="c0">poor in spirit</span><span class="c4">, Christ can never become dear, because He is obscured by self. We cannot recognize His glory until we know how helpless, worthless, and sinful we are. Where self is exalted, Christ cannot be. This beatitude is first because humility must precede everything else.<br>(MacArthur)</span></p><p class="c2"><span>5:3: (</span><span class="c1">Achieving Humility</span><span>) How do we become </span><span class="c0">poor in spirit</span><span>? Almost by definition, it cannot start with us, with anything we can do or accomplish in our own power. Humility simply starts with recognizing the truth. Humility is not human work, but a necessary divine work to make us see that we are unworthy and cannot change our condition without God. <br>This is why things like monasticism, asceticism, physical self-denial, and other self-efforts are so futile: they feed pride rather than subdue it, because they give a person a reason to boast in what he has done or not done.<br>Even though it is the Lord Who does the work of humbling, it is never without personal cooperation. This is why there are numerous divine commands to humble oneself (Mt 18:4; 23:12; Jas 4:10; 1 Pet 5:5).<br>The first step in experiencing humility is to turn our eyes off ourselves and to look to God. To seek humility, we do not look at ourselves to find the faults, but at God Almighty to behold His perfection; that allows us to see ourselves as sinners by contrast. When we study His Word, seek His face in prayer, and sincerely desire to be near Him and please Him, we move toward being </span><span class="c0">poor in spirit</span><span class="c4">.<br>Second, we must remove and avoid those things that promote pride. Being given praise is not evil, but seeking it and glorying in it is. Third, ask God for humility: like every other good gift, it only comes from God. &ldquo;Create in me a clean heart&rdquo; (Ps 51:10). <br>(MacArthur)</span></p><p class="c2"><span>5:3: (</span><span class="c1">Knowing When We are Humble</span><span class="c4">) Thomas Watson gives 7 principles we may apply in determining humility. 1) One who is poor in spirit loses his self-preoccupation. Self is nothing, and Christ is everything. &ldquo;I have been crucified with Christ; and it is no longer I who live, but Christ lives in me&rdquo; (Gal 2:20). 2) Humility will lead us to be lost in the wonder of Christ. Our satisfaction will be in the prospect of one day being fully in the likeness of our Lord. 3) We will not complain about our situation, no matter how bad it may become. Because we know we deserve worse than anything we can experience in this life, we will consider no circumstance to be unfair. 4) We will more clearly see the strengths and virtues of others as well as our own weaknesses and sins. We will &ldquo;regard one another as more important than [ourselves]&rdquo; (Php 2:3). 5) We will spend much time in prayer. We will knock often at heaven&rsquo;s gate because we are always in need. 6) We will take Christ on His terms and will not modify His standards to our own liking. His Word alone will be our standard. 7) When we are poor in spirit, we will praise and thank God for His grace. He knows that he has no blessings and no happiness but that which the Father gives.<br>(MacArthur)</span></p><p class="c2"><span>5:3: (</span><span class="c1">The Result of Being Poor in Spirit</span><span>). Those who come to the King in this humility inherit His</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;kingdom of Heaven</span><span class="c4">.

So self-evident and obvious: pleasure brings happiness, money, entertainment, fame and praise bring happiness; and avoiding pain, trouble, disappointment, frustration, hardships brings happiness. Jesus reversed the path to happiness.<br>The world says, hide your problems and sins and pretend to be happy. But Jesus says, confess your sins, and mourn, mourn, mourn. This is how genuine happiness will come: through mourning and forgiveness.<br>(MacArthur)</span></p><p class="c2"><span>5:4: (</span><span class="c1">Improper Mourning, Proper Mourning, Godly mourning</span><span>) Improper </span><span class="c0">mourning</span><span>&nbsp;is the sorrow of those who are frustrated in fulfilling evil plans and lusts, or who have misguided loyalties and affection. To those who mourn in that way the Lord offers no help of solace. Even legitimate sorrow can be carried to illegitimate extremes: e.g. a long paralyzing grief over the loss of a loved one is essentially selfish.<br>Reasonable </span><span class="c0">mourning</span><span>&nbsp;is appropriate in some cases: it opens an escape valve that keeps our feelings from poisoning our emotions. That&rsquo;s our reaction to loss, expression of concern.<br>But the </span><span class="c0">mourning</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;about which Jesus speaks has nothing to do with those types. Jesus is speaking of godly sorrow: a mourning that only those who sincerely desire to belong to Him or who already belong to Him can experience. This is the only sorrow that brings spiritual life and growth: sorrow over sin that leads to repentance: &ldquo;For godly grief produces a repentance that leads to salvation without regret, whereas worldly grief produces death&rdquo; (1 Cor 7:10). Godly sorrow is linked to repentance.</span></p><p class="c2"><span>5:4: (</span><span class="c1">the logical sequence and progression of beatitudes</span><span>) Spiritual poverty (v. 3) leads to godly sorrow; the poor in spirit become </span><span class="c0">those who mourn</span><span>. </span><span class="c1"><br></span><span class="c4">(MacArthur)</span></p><p class="c2"><span>5:4: (</span><span class="c1">the meaning of </span><span class="c1 c0">sorrow</span><span>) Of the nine terms used in Greek for </span><span class="c0">sorrow</span><span>, the one used here (Gk. </span><span class="c3">Pentheo</span><span class="c4">) is the strongest, the most severe. It represents the deepest, most heart-felt grief, and was generally reserved for grieving over the death of a loved one. It carries the idea of deep inner agony, which may or may not be expressed by outward weeping, wailing, or lament.(MacArthur)</span></p><p class="c2"><span>5:4: (</span><span class="c1">the meaning of blessedness</span><span>) </span><span class="c0">Blessedness</span><span class="c4">, or happiness, does not come in the mourning itself, but with what God does in response to it, with the forgiveness that such mourning brings. God&rsquo;s forgiveness of human sin. <br>Only mourners over sin are happy because only mourners over sin have their sins forgiven. Sin and happiness are totally incompatible: where one exists, the other cannot. Until sin is forgiven and removed, happiness is locked out. But mourning over sin brings forgiveness of sin, and forgiveness of sin brings freedom and a joy that cannot be experienced in any other way.<br>(MacArthur)</span></p><p class="c2"><span>5:4: (</span><span class="c1">defective sense of humor</span><span>) How James explains it: &ldquo;Cleanse your hands, you sinners, and purify your hearts, you double-minded. Be wretched and </span><span class="c0">mourn</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;and weep. Let your laughter be turned to mourning and your joy to gloom. Humble yourselves before the Lord, and he will exalt you.&rdquo; (Jas 4:8-10)<br>There is a great need in the church today to cry instead of laugh, and start growing in the awareness of sin. We follow the sinful world vicariously, if not actually, when we laugh at the world&rsquo;s crude and immoral jokes even though we do not retell them, when we are entertained by a sin even though we do not indulge in it, when we smile at ungodly talk even though we do not repeat the words. To joke about divorce, to make light of brutality, to be intrigued by sexual immorality is to rejoice when we should be mourning, to be laughing when we should be crying. <br>A defective sense of sin is reflected in a defective sense of humor. The way to happiness is not in making light of sin, but rather in sorrow over it that cries to God.<br>(MacArthur)</span></p><p class="c2"><span>5:4: (</span><span class="c1">continuity</span><span>) </span><span class="c0">Those who mourn</span><span>&nbsp;(Gk. </span><span class="c3">Penthountes</span><span class="c4">) is a present participle, indicating continuous action,<br>The faithful child of God is constantly broken over his sinfulness. To grow in grace is also to grow in awareness of sin. The mark of the mature life is not sinlessness, which is reserved for heaven, but growing awareness of sinfulness. The subjects of God&rsquo;s Kingdom are characterized by continual confession of sin.<br>(MacArthur)</span></p><p class="c2"><span>5:4: (</span><span class="c1">vs. despair</span><span>) </span><span class="c0">Mourning</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;over sin is not being engulfed in despair. True mourning over sin does not focus on ourselves either, not even on our sin; but it focuses on God, Who alone can forgive and remove our sin. (MacArthur)</span></p><p class="c2"><span>5:4: (</span><span class="c1">the result of mourning</span><span>) It is not the </span><span class="c0">mourning</span><span>&nbsp;that </span><span class="c0">blesses</span><span>, but the </span><span class="c0">comfort</span><span>&nbsp;God gives to those who mourn in a godly way. The blessing of God&rsquo;s comfort is reserved exclusively for the contrite of heart (</span><span class="c0">they</span><span>&nbsp;(Gk. </span><span class="c3">autos</span><span>) indicates that it applies </span><span class="c3">only</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;to such mourners).

(MacArthur)</span></p><p class="c2"><span>5:4: </span><span class="c0">Shall be</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;does not refer to the end of the age, but to the immediate future that follows mourning.

(MacArthur)</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c13">5:4: (</span><span class="c1 c13">What does true mourning over sin involve</span><span class="c13">) The first step requires removing the hindrances that keep us from mourning: the things that make us content with ourselves, that make us resist God&rsquo;s Spirit and question His Word, and that harden our hearts.<br></span><span class="c3 c13">Love of sin</span><span class="c13">&nbsp;is the primary hindrance of mourning: holding on to sin will freeze and petrify a heart. A stony heart does not mourn.<br></span><span class="c3 c13">Despair</span><span class="c13">&nbsp;hinders mourning because it gives up on God, refusing to believe that He can save and help. Despair puts ourselves outside God&rsquo;s grace. The one who despairs believes he is destined to sin. Because he believes God has given up on him, he gives up on God.<br></span><span class="c3 c13">Conceit</span><span class="c13">&nbsp;is a hindrance because it tries to hide the sin itself, choosing to believe that there is nothing over which to mourn. It is comparable to a doctor treating cancer as if it were a cold. If it was necessary for Jesus Christ to shed His blood on the cross to save us from our sin, our sin must be great indeed!<br></span><span class="c3 c13">Presumption</span><span class="c13">&nbsp;hinders mourning because it is really a form of pride. It recognizes the need for grace, but is satisfied with cheap grace, and sees sin as not bad enough to be confessed, repented of, and forsaken. <br></span><span class="c3 c13">Procrastination</span><span class="c9">&nbsp;hinders godly mourning simply by putting it off until the right day, state, or circumstance. But it is foolish and dangerous because we &ldquo;do not know what [our] life will be like tomorrow&rdquo; (Jas 4:14). It sin is not dealt with, we have no assurance that comfort will ever come, because we have no assurance we will have time to confess it later.<br>The most important step we can take in getting rid of hindrances to mourning, whatever they are, is to look at the holiness of God and the great sacrifice of sin-bearing at the cross. If seeing Christ die for our sins does not thaw a cold heart or break up a hardened hard, it is beyond melting or breaking.<br>The second step is to study sin in Scripture, to learn what an evil and repulsive thing it is to God and what a destructive and damning thing it is to us. Sin tramples on God&rsquo;s laws, makes light of His love, grieves His Spirit, spurns His forgiveness and blessing, and in every way resists His grace.<br>The third step toward godly mourning is to pray for contriteness of heart, which only God can give and which He never refuses to give to those who ask. It must always be recognized that humility depends on the working of the Lord.<br>(MacArthur)</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c13">5:4: (</span><span class="c1 c13">How to know if we are mourning as Christ commands</span><span class="c9">) First, we need to ask ourselves if we are sensitive to sin. If we laugh at it, take it lightly, or enjoy it, we can be sure we are not mourning over it and are outside the sphere of God&rsquo;s blessing<br>The mock righteousness of hypocrites who make every effort to appear holy on the outside (Mt&nbsp;6:1-18) has no sensititity to sin, only sensitivity to personal prestige and reputation. Nor does the mock gratitude of those who thank God they are better than other people (Lk 18:11)..<br>The godly mourner will have true sorrow for his sins. His first concern is for the harm his sin does to God&rsquo;s glory, not the harm its exposure might bring to his own reputation or welfare.<br>If our mourning is godly, we will grieve for the sins of fellow believers and for the sins of the world. We will look out over the community where we live and weep, as Jesus looked out over Jerusalem and wept.<br>The second way to determine if we have genuine mourning over sin is to check our sense of God&rsquo;s forgiveness. Have we experienced the release and freedom of knowing our sins are forgiven? Do we have His peace and joy in our life? Can we point to true happiness He has given in response to our mourning? Do we have the divine comfort He promises to those who have forgiven, cleansed, and purified lives?<br>(MacArthur)</span></p><p class="c2 c10"><span class="c4"></span></p><h4 class="c25" id="h.ll20fx141tgb"><span class="c15 c0">&ldquo;Blessed are the meek, for they shall inherit the earth.</span></h4><p class="c2"><span>5:5: Not the powerful, but the </span><span class="c0">gentle</span><span>&nbsp;will </span><span class="c0">inherit the earth</span><span>.

As a human attitude, it meant being gentle of spirit, meek, submissive, quiet, tenderhearted. <br></span><span class="c0">Meekness</span><span>&nbsp;does not connote weakness. Meekness means power put under control. (Prov 16:32: &ldquo;Whoever is slow to anger is better than the mighty, and he who rules his spirit than he who takes a city&ldquo;). An unbroken wild animal is useless; medicine that is too strong kills; emotion out of control destroys, and has no place in God&rsquo;s kingdom.<br></span><span class="c0">Meekness</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;is the opposite of violence and vengeance. The meek person has died to self, and he therefore does not worry about injury to himself, or about loss, insult, or abuse. The meek person does not defend himself and does not stand up for his rights: he stands humbly before God, knowing he has nothing to commend himself. <br>Meekness is not lack of conviction nor mere human niceness, but its courage, its strength, its conviction, and its pleasantness come from God, not from self. Meekness is not weakness, but it does not use its power for its own defense or selfish purposes. Meekness is power completely surrendered to God&rsquo;s control.<br>The spirit of meekness is the spirit of Christ, who, being the only human being who did no wrong, never defended Himself. He was zealous about the purity of His Father&rsquo;s house (Jn 2:14-15: the cleansing of the Temple), but Jesus did not once raise a finger or give a single retort in HIs own defense.<br>(MacArthur)</span></p><p class="c2"><span>5:5: (</span><span class="c1">vs. poverty in spirit</span><span class="c4">) Poverty in spirit focuses on our sinfulness, whereas meekness focuses on God&rsquo;s holiness. Humility underlies both virtues: when we look honestly at ourselves, we are made humble by seeing how sinful and unworthy we are; when we look at God, we are made humble by seeing how righteous and worthy He is. (MacArthur)</span></p><p class="c2"><span>5:5: (</span><span class="c1">logical sequence and progression of Beatitudes)</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>Logical progression: being poor in spirit causes us to turn away from ourselves in mourning (negative), and </span><span class="c0">meekness</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;causes us to turn toward God in seeking His righteousness (positive). <br>The blessings of the Beatitudes are for those who are realistic about their sinfulness, who are repentant of their sins, and who are responsive to God in His righteousness. Those who are unblessed, unhappy, and shut out of the kingdom are the proud, the arrogant, the unrepentant &mdash; the self-sufficient and self-righteous who see in themselves no unworthiness and feel no need for God&rsquo;s help and God&rsquo;s righteousness. (MacArthur)</span></p><p class="c2"><span>5:5: (</span><span class="c1">self-righteous</span><span>) Most of Jesus&rsquo; hearers, like fallen men throughout history, were concerned about justifying their own ways, defending their own rights, and serving their own ends. The way of </span><span class="c0">meekness</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;was not their way, and therefore the true kingdom was not their kingdom. (MacArthur)</span></p><p class="c2"><span>5:5: (</span><span class="c1">the result of meekness)</span><span>&nbsp;The general result is being </span><span class="c0">blessed</span><span>: being made divinely happy. God gives the meek His own joy and gladness.<br>More specifically, however, they </span><span class="c0">will inherit the earth</span><span>. When God reclaims His earthly domain, those who have become His children through faith in His Son will rule that domain with Him.<br>The word </span><span class="c0">inherit</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;(kleronomeo) refers to the receiving of one&rsquo;s allotted portion, one&rsquo;s rightful inheritance.<br>(MacArthur)</span></p><p class="c2"><span>5:5: (</span><span class="c1">the necessity for meekness</span><span>) The emphatic pronoun </span><span class="c0">they</span><span>&nbsp;(Gk. </span><span class="c3">autos</span><span>) &nbsp;is again used, indicating that </span><span class="c3">only</span><span>&nbsp;those who are meek </span><span class="c0">shall inherit the earth</span><span class="c4">. Meekness is therefore necessary for salvation (Ps 149:4: &ldquo;He crowns the humble with salvation&rdquo;). <br>&ldquo;Unless you .. become like children, you shall not enter the kingdom of heaven. Whoever humbles himself as this child, he is the greatest in the kingdom of heaven&rdquo; (Mt 18:2-4). <br>&ldquo;In humility we receive the word implanted, which is able to save your soul&rdquo; (Jas 1:21). Without humility one can&rsquo;t listen rightly to God&rsquo;s word, much less understand and receive it.<br>&ldquo;...always being ready to make a defense to everyone ho asks &hellip; yet with gentleness&rdquo; (1 Pet 3:15). Without meekness, we cannot witness effectively: pride will always stand between our testimony and those to whom we testify. They will see us instead of the Lord, no matter how orthodox our theology or how refined our technique. Meekness is necessary because only meekness gives glory to God. Pride seeks its own glory, but meekness seeks God&rsquo;s.<br>(MacArthur)</span></p><p class="c2"><span>5:5: (</span><span class="c1">the unrighteous</span><span>) &ldquo;the unrighteous shall not inherit the kingdom of God&rdquo; (1 Cor 6:9). The wicked and godless seem to prosper today, but that is for a time; God assured His people that &ldquo; In just a little while, the wicked will be no more; though you look carefully at his place, he will not be there. But the meek shall inherit the land and delight themselves in abundant peace.&ldquo;&nbsp;(Ps 37:10-11). Our responsibility is to trust the Lord and obey His will; and exactly in the right time and in the right way, He will settle the accounts.

A starving person has a single, all-consuming passion for food and water. Nothing else has the slightest attraction or appeal; nothing else can even get his attention. This is the kind of hunger and thirst of which Jesus speaks in this beatitude. And Jesus&rsquo; using the present participle signifies continuous longing, continuous seeking.<br>Jesus declares that the deepest desire of every person ought to be </span><span class="c0">to hunger and thirst for righteousness</span><span>, and therein lies the way to being truly </span><span class="c0">blessed</span><span class="c4">. This holy ambition contrasts with the common ambitions of men to gratify their own lusts, accomplish their own goals, and satisfy their own egos. (MacArthur)</span></p><p class="c2"><span>5:6: To be </span><span class="c0">hungry</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;is not enough; I must be really starving to know what is in God&rsquo;s heart toward me. When the prodigal son was hungry, he went to feed on the husks, but when he was starving, he turned to his father. (John Darby)</span></p><p class="c2"><span>5:6: (</span><span class="c1">the necessity for spiritual hunger</span><span>) </span><span class="c0">Hunger and thirst</span><span>&nbsp;represent the necessities of physical life.

We can no more live spiritually without righteousness than we can live physically without food and water.<br>Seeking satisfaction not in the things of the world but only in God and in His provision is a mark of those who come into His kingdom. They desire sin to be replaced with virtue and disobedience to be replaced by obedience They are eager to serve the Word and will of God.<br>The person who has no hunger and thirst for righteousness has no part in God&rsquo;s kingdom. To have God&rsquo;s life within us through the new birth in Jesus Christ is to desire more of His likeness within us by growing in righteousness. The true believer desires to obey, even though he struggles with unredeemed flesh.<br>(MacArthur)</span></p><p class="c2"><span>5:6: (</span><span class="c1">logical sequence and progression of beatitudes</span><span>) Becoming poor in spirit involves death to self. Mourning over sin involves facing up to our sinfulness. Becoming meek involves surrendering our power to God&rsquo;s control. The fourth beatitude is more positive and is a consequence of the other three. When we put aside self, sins, and power, and turn to the Lord, we are given a great desire for righteousness. The more we put away what we have, the more we long for what God has.<br>When a person abandons all hope of saving himself, all confidence in self-righteousness, and begins to hunger for the salvation that brings God&rsquo;s righteousness and the obedience that God requires, he will be </span><span class="c0">blessed</span><span class="c4">, be made divinely happy.<br>(MacArthur)</span></p><p class="c2"><span>5:6: (</span><span class="c1">the specific righteousness, and all or it</span><span>) When speaking about </span><span class="c0">hunger in thirst</span><span>, Greeks would normally use the </span><span class="c3">partitive genitive</span><span>: a case than indicates partialness, i.e. &ldquo;some food&rdquo; or &ldquo;some water&rdquo;. But Jesus uses the accusative, and therefore, </span><span class="c0">righteousness</span><span>&nbsp;is unqualified and unlimited. The Lord identifies those who desire all the righteousness there is.<br>No believer ever &ldquo;arrives&rdquo; to righteousness in his spiritual life until he reaches heaven. Children of the kingdom never stop needing or hungering for more of God&rsquo;s righteousness and holiness to be manifest in them through obedience. We cannot possibly have our longing for godliness satisfied in this life, so we are left to continually hunger and thirst until the day we are clothed entirely in Christ&rsquo;s righteousness.<br>Jesus also uses the definite article (</span><span class="c3">ten</span><span>), indicating that He is not speaking of just any righteousness, but </span><span class="c3 c0">the</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;righteousness</span><span class="c4">, the only true righteousness &mdash; that which comes from God and, in fact, is God&rsquo;s very own righteousness which He has in Himself. <br>(MacArthur)</span></p><p class="c2"><span>5:6: (</span><span class="c1">the result of spiritual hunger</span><span>) The result is being </span><span class="c0">satisfied</span><span>. Feeding until being full. Jesus&rsquo; divine pronouncement is that those who hunger and thirst for righteousness will be given total satisfaction. The giving of satisfaction si God&rsquo;s work, as the future passive tense indicates: </span><span class="c0">they will be satisfied</span><span class="c4">. Our part is to seek; His part is to satisfy.<br>Jesus satisfies with a water drinking which a person would never thirst (Jn 4:14, woman at the well), and with a bread, eating which a person shall not hunger (Jn 6:35, the feeding of the 5000).<br>(MacArthur)</span></p><p class="c2"><span>5:6: (</span><span class="c1">the testing of spiritual hunger</span><span class="c4">) There are several marks of genuine hunger and thirst for God&rsquo;s righteousness. 1) Dissatisfaction with self. One who is pleased with his own righteousness will see no need for God&rsquo;s. 2) Freedom from dependence on external things for satisfaction. Nothing but God&rsquo;s own righteousness can satisfy the person who has true spiritual hunger and thirst. 3) Craving for the Word of God, the basic spiritual food He provides His children. The more we seek God&rsquo;s righteousness, the more we will want to devour Scripture. 4) The pleasantness of the things of God. Even the Lord&rsquo;s reproofs and discipline bring satisfaction, because they are signs of our Father&rsquo;s love. 5) Genuine hunger is unconditional and will seek and accept God&rsquo;s righteousness in whatever way He chooses to provide it, and will obey His commands no matter how demanding they may be. The least of God&rsquo;s righteousness is more valuable than the greatest of anything we possess in ourselves or that the world can offer. <br>(MacArthur)</span></p><p class="c2 c10"><span class="c4"></span></p><h4 class="c25" id="h.aypztqeqpmaw"><span class="c15 c0">&ldquo;Blessed are the merciful, for they shall receive mercy.</span></h4><p class="c2"><span>5:7: Those who show </span><span class="c0">mercy</span><span>&nbsp;by the spirit of God, will be shown </span><span class="c0">mercy</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;by God.

Those who in poverty of spirit recognize their need of </span><span class="c0">mercy</span><span>&nbsp;are led to show </span><span class="c0">mercy</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;to others. Those who mourn over their sin are led to purity of heart. Those who are meek always seek to make peace. And those who hunger and thirst for righteousness are never unwilling to pay the price of being persecuted for righteousness&rsquo; sake. (MacArthur)</span></p><p class="c2"><span>5:7: (</span><span class="c1">worldly reciprocal mercy</span><span>) For the most part, the days in which Jesus lived and taught were not characterized by </span><span class="c0">mercy</span><span class="c4">. The Jewish religionists themselves were not inclined to show mercy because mercy is not a characteristic of those who are proud, self-righteous, and judgmental. To many, perhaps &mdash; most, of Jesus&rsquo; hearers, mercy was considered one of the least of virtues. It was in the same category as love: reserved for those who had shown the virtue to you. You loved those who loved you, and you showed mercy to those who showed mercy to you. (Mt 5:43: &ldquo;You have heard that it was said, &lsquo;You shall love your neighbor and hate your enemy.&rdquo;). But such a shallow, selfish kind of love that even the outcast tax-gatherers practiced was not acceptable to the Savior (Mt 5:46: &ldquo;For if you love those who love you, what reward do you have? Do not even the tax collectors do the same?&rdquo;). <br>Other people see this beatitude in another way that is just as selfish and humanistic: mercy given will mean mercy received. For such people, mercy is shown to others purely in an effort toward self-seeking.<br>The underlying motive of self-concern has characterized men since the Fall. We see it expressed today in such sayings as &ldquo;If you don&rsquo;t look out for yourself, no one else will.&rdquo; Such popular proverbs are generally true, because they reflect the basic selfish nature of fallen man. Men are not naturally inclined to show mercy.<br>(MacArthur)</span></p><p class="c2"><span>5:7: (</span><span class="c1">the power of the father in Roman culture</span><span>) During much of Roman history, a father had the right of </span><span class="c3">patria opitestas</span><span class="c4">, of deciding whether or not his newborn child would live or die. As the infant was held up for him to see, the father would turn his thumb up if he wanted the child to live, down if he wanted it to die. If this thumb turned down, the child was immediately drowned. Citizens had the same life-or-death power over slaves. At any time and for any reason they could kill and bury a slave, with no fear of arrest or reprisal. Husbands could even have their wives put to death on the least provocation. (MacArthur)<br>In practice, the extreme form of the father&rsquo;s right was seldom exercised. It was eventually limited by law. (Wikipedia)</span></p><p class="c2"><span>5:7: The fifth beatitude does not teach that </span><span class="c0">mercy</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;to men brings mercy from men, but that mercy to men brings mercy from God. God will be merciful to use, whether men are or are not. God is the subject of the second clause, just as in the other beatitudes.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (MacArthur)</span></p><p class="c2"><span>5:7: (</span><span class="c1">the meaning of mercy</span><span>) </span><span class="c0">Merciful</span><span>&nbsp;(Gk. </span><span class="c3">ele&#275;mones</span><span>): beneficial, charitable. The basic meaning is to give help to the afflicted and to rescue the helpless. It is compassion in action.<br>Jesus is not speaking of detached or powerless sentiment, nor is He speaking of feigned pity that gives help only to a guilty conscience or to impress others with its appearance of virtue. And it is not passive, silent concern which, though genuine, is unable to give tangible help. <br>It is not simply feeling compassion, but showing compassion. </span><span class="c0">Mercy</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;is genuine compassion expressed in genuine help, selfless concern expressed in selfless deeds.</span></p><p class="c2"><span>5:7: (</span><span class="c1">mercy, forgiveness, love</span><span>)<br></span><span class="c0">Mercy</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;has much in common wit forgiveness. Forgiveness flows out of mercy, and mercy flows out of love. Mercy is more than forgiveness; and love is more than mercy, because it manifests itself in many ways that do not involve either forgiveness or mercy: love loves even when there is no wrong to forgive or need to meet.<br>Mercy is the physician; love is the friend. Mercy acts because of need; love acts because of affection, whether there is need or not. Mercy is reserved for times of trouble; love is constant. There can be no true mercy apart from love, but there can be true love apart from mercy.<br>(MacArthur)</span></p><p class="c2"><span>5:7: (</span><span class="c1">mercy, grace</span><span>) </span><span class="c0">Mercy</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;is also related to grace. In each of his three pastoral epistles Paul includes the words &ldquo;grace, mercy and peace&rdquo; in his salutations (1 Tim 1:2; 2 TIm 1:2; Titus 1:4). Mercy is closely related with grace, yet they are different. Mercy has to do with pain, misery, and distress: the consequences of sin. Grace, on the other hand, deals with sin itself. Mercy deals with the symptoms, grace with the cause. Mercy offers relief from punishment; grace offers pardon for the crime. Mercy eliminates the pain; grace cures the disease. Mercy relates to the negative; grace relates to the positive.<br>When the Good Samaritan bound up the wounds of the man, he showed mercy. When he paid for his lodging, he showed grace.<br>(MacArthur)</span></p><p class="c2"><span>5:7: (</span><span class="c1">mercy, justice</span><span>) God&rsquo;s </span><span class="c0">mercy</span><span>&nbsp;does not ignore sin: God does not show </span><span class="c0">mercy</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;without punishing sin; and for Him to offer mercy without punishment would negate His justice.<br>Mercy that ignores sin is false mercy: wickedness has to be dealt with, otherwise, the warm attitude will reinforce it (as was the case with David&rsquo;s son Absalom). <br>That sort of false mercy is common in our day. It is thought to be unloving and unkind to hold people responsible for their sins. But that is a cheap grace that is not just and is not merciful. Because if overlooks sin, it leaves sin, and the one who relies on that sort of mercy is left in his sin. To cancel justice is to cancel mercy: these two are met together.<br>(MacArthur)</span></p><p class="c2"><span>5:7: (</span><span class="c1">the price of mercy</span><span>) In every true act of </span><span class="c0">mercy</span><span class="c4">, someone pays the price. To be merciful is to bear the load for someone else. The Good Samaritan did pay the price. And God&rsquo;s mercy is not grounded in sentiment but in Christ&rsquo;s atoning blood which paid the penalty for and cleanses from sin those who believe in Him. The good news of the Gospel is not that God winked at justice, glossed over sin, and compromised righteousness; the good news is that in the shedding of Christ&rsquo;s blood justice was satisfied, sin was forgiven, righteousness was fulfilled, and mercy was made available. There is never an excuse for sin, but always a remedy. (MacArthur) &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c2"><span>5:7: </span><span class="c0">Mercy</span><span class="c4">, therefore, is one than forgiveness and less than love. It is different from grace and is one with justice. And what is true of God&rsquo;s mercy should be true of ours. (MacArthur)</span></p><p class="c2"><span>5:7: (</span><span class="c1">mercy is giving</span><span>) In the midst of our corrupt, ego-centered, and selfish society that tells us to grab everything we can get, the voice of God tells us to give everything we can give. The true character of </span><span class="c0">mercy</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;is in giving: giving compassion, giving help, giving time, giving forgiveness, giving money, giving ourselves. <br>The children of the King are merciful. Those who are merciless face judgment: &ldquo;for judgement will be merciless to one who has shown no mercy&rdquo;; but &nbsp;&ldquo;mercy triumphs over judgment&rdquo; (Jas 2:13).<br>(MacArthur)</span></p><p class="c2"><span>5:7: (</span><span class="c1">the source of mercy</span><span>) We can be </span><span class="c0">merciful</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;only when we have experienced God&rsquo;s mercy. Mercy is only for those who through grace and divine power bow humbly before God in poverty of spirit, who mourn over and turn from their sin, who are meek and submissive to His control, and who hunger and thirst above all else for His righteousness. They way of mercy is the way of humility, repentance, surrender, and holiness. (MacArthur)</span></p><p class="c2"><span>5:7: (</span><span class="c1">showing spiritual mercy</span><span>) </span><span class="c0">Mercy</span><span>&nbsp;is also to be shown spiritually. <br>First, </span><span class="c0">mercy</span><span>&nbsp;is shown through pity. Augustine said: &ldquo;If I weep for the body from which the soul is departed, should I not weep for the soul from which God is departed?&rdquo; The sensitive Christian will grieve more for lost souls that for lost bodies. Because we have experienced God&rsquo;s mercy, we are to have great concern for those who have not.<br>Examples: Jesus&rsquo;s mercy for His executioners (Lk 23:34: &ldquo;Father, forgive them, for they know not what they do&rdquo;). Stephen prayed for those who were taking his life (Ac 7:60: &ldquo;Lord, do not hold this sin against them.&rdquo;). <br>Second, we are to show spiritual </span><span class="c0">mercy</span><span>&nbsp;by confrontation. Paul says we should &ldquo;correct his opponents with gentleness. God may perhaps grant them repentance leading to a knowledge of the truth&rdquo; (2 Tim 2:25). We are to be willing to confront others about their sin in order that they might come to God for salvation. Love and mercy will be severe when that is necessary for the sake of an erring brother. In such cases it is cruel to say nothing and let the harm continue.<br>Third, we are to show spiritual </span><span class="c0">mercy</span><span>&nbsp;by praying. The sacrifice of prayer for those without God is an act of mercy. Our mercy can be measured by out prayer for the unsaved and for Christians who are walking in disobedience.<br>Fourth, we are to show spiritual </span><span class="c0">mercy</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;by proclaiming the saving gospel of Jesus Christ &mdash; the most merciful thing we can do. <br>(MacArthur)</span></p><p class="c2"><span>5:7: (</span><span class="c1">the result of mercy</span><span>) We see God&rsquo;s cycle of </span><span class="c0">mercy</span><span>: God is merciful to us by saving us through Christ; in obedience, we are merciful to others; and God, in faithfulness, gives us even more mercy, pouring out blessing for our needs and withholding severe chastening for our sin. <br>As in other beatitudes, the emphatic pronoun </span><span class="c3">autos</span><span>&nbsp;(</span><span class="c0">they</span><span>) indicates that </span><span class="c3">only</span><span>&nbsp;those who are merciful qualify to </span><span class="c0">receive mercy</span><span>&nbsp;from God. But &ldquo;judgment will be merciless to one who has shown no mercy&rdquo; (Jas 2:13). &ldquo;But if you do not forgive men, they your Father will not forgive your transgressions&rdquo; (Mt 6:14-15).<br>We do not earn salvation by being merciful. We must be saved by God&rsquo;s mercy before we can truly </span><span class="c3">be</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;merciful.</span></p><p class="c2 c10"><span class="c4"></span></p><h4 class="c25" id="h.crkkiamz2oau"><span class="c15 c0">&ldquo;Blessed are the pure in heart, for they shall see God.</span></h4><p class="c2"><span>5:8: &ldquo;</span><span class="c0">Blessed</span><span>&nbsp;[anticipating God&rsquo;s presence, spiritually mature] are the </span><span class="c0">pure in heart</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;[those with integrity, moral courage, and godly character], for they will see God.&rdquo; (AMP)</span></p><p class="c2"><span>5:8: A </span><span class="c0">pure heart</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;cannot come from the unsaved man.

Being accepted by Him is a matter of internal transformation.<br></span><span class="c0">Heart</span><span>&nbsp;is universally used metaphorically to represent the inner person, the seat of motives and attitudes, the center of personality. In Scripture it represents much more than emotion, feelings: it also includes the thinking process and particularly the will. The heart is the control center of mind and will as well as emotion. <br></span><span class="c0">Pure</span><span>&nbsp;translates </span><span class="c3">katharos</span><span>, a form of the word from which we get </span><span class="c3">catharsis</span><span>&nbsp;(cleansing of the mind or emotions). The basic meaning is to make pure by cleansing from dirt, filth, and contamination. The Greek word is related to the Latin </span><span class="c3">catus</span><span>&nbsp;(morally pure, guiltless, pure, chaste, pious), from which we get </span><span class="c3">chaste</span><span class="c4">. The related word chasten refers to discipline given in order to cleanse from wrong behavior.<br>The Greek term was often used of metals that had been refined until all impurities were removed, leaving only pure metal. In that sense, purity means unmixed, unalloyed, unadulterated. Applied to the heart, the idea is that of pure motive: of single-mindedness, undivided devotion, spiritual integrity, and true righteousness. </span></p><p class="c2"><span>5:8: (</span><span class="c1">double-mindedness</span><span class="c4">) Purity means single-mindedness. Double-mindedness has always been one of the great plagues of the church. We want to serve the Lord and follow the world at the same time; but that is impossible (Mt 6:24: &ldquo;no one can serve two masters&rdquo;; Jas 4:4: &ldquo;Do you not know that friendship with the world is enmity with God?&rdquo;). James gives the solution to the problem in Jas 4:8: &ldquo;Draw near to God, and he will draw near to you. Cleanse your hands, you sinners, and purify your hearts, you double-minded.&rdquo;. (MacArthur)</span></p><p class="c2"><span>5:8: (</span><span class="c1">outward religion vs matters of the heart</span><span>) In contrast to the outward and hypocritical religion of the scribes and Pharisees, Jesus said that it is in the inner man, in the core of his very being, that God requires </span><span class="c0">purity</span><span class="c4">. That was not a new truth, but an old one long forgotten amidst ceremony and tradition (Prov 4:23: &ldquo;Keep your heart with all vigilance&rdquo;; Gen 6:5: God destroyed the earth in the flood because of a human heart: &ldquo;every intent of the thoughts of [man&rsquo;s] heart was only evil continually&rdquo;).<br>(MacArthur)</span></p><p class="c2"><span>5:8: (</span><span class="c1">purity of heart vs. sincerity</span><span>) </span><span class="c0">Purity of heart </span><span class="c4">is more than sincerity. A motive can be sincere, yet lead to worthless and sinful things: a sincere devotion to a spirit or a shrine may be sincerely wrong and completely worthless before God. Even genuinely good deeds that do not come from a genuinely good heart are of no spiritual value. We cannot please God unless our hearts are right with Him.<br>The ultimate standard for purity of heart is perfection of heart. And those who truly belong to God will be motivated by purity.<br>(MacArthur)</span></p><p class="c2"><span>5:8: (</span><span class="c1">men&rsquo;s judgment of themselves vs God&rsquo;s standard</span><span class="c4">) Men are inclined to judge ourselves by the worst instead of best. We are all tempted to feel better about ourselves when we see someone doing a terrible thing that we have never done. The &ldquo;good&rdquo; person looks down on the one who seems to be less good than himself, and that person looks down on those worse than he is. In the end, the world judges itself by the worst and most rotten people on earth.<br>God&rsquo;s standard for men, however, is Himself. Only those who are pure as He is pure may enter the kingdom. It is impurity of heart that separates man from God (Is 59:2: &ldquo;but your iniquities have made a separation between you and your God, and your sins have hidden his face from you so that he does not hear.&rdquo;). And just as impurity of heart separates men from God, only purity of heart through Jesus Christ will reconcile men to God. (MacArthur)</span></p><p class="c2"><span>5:8: (</span><span class="c1">head religion, hand religion, and heart religion</span><span class="c4">) Basically, there are but two kinds of religion: the religion of human achievement and the religion of divine accomplishment. Within the religions of human accomplishment are two basic approaches: head religion, which trusts in creeds and religious knowledge, and hand religion, which trusts in good deeds. There are many variations of the first kind, which includes every religion but biblical Christianity. <br>The only true religion, however, is heart religion, which is based on God&rsquo;s implanted purity by faith in what God has done through His Son. When God imputes His righteousness to us He imputes His purity to us.<br>(MacArthur)</span></p><p class="c2"><span>5:8: (</span><span class="c1">six kinds of purity</span><span>) In Scripture, we discover six kinds of purity. <br>1) </span><span class="c3">primal purity</span><span>: the kind that exists only in God. That purity is essential to God as light is to the sun or wetness is to water. <br>2) </span><span class="c3">created purity</span><span>: the purity that existed in God&rsquo;s creation before it was corrupted by the Fall. <br>3) </span><span class="c3">positional purity</span><span>: the purity we are given the moment we trust in Jesus Christ. When we trust in Him, God imputes to use Christ&rsquo;s own purity, Christ&rsquo;s own righteousness. <br>4) with imputed purity, </span><span class="c3">actual purity</span><span>&nbsp;is granted to us by God in the new nature of the believer (Rom 6:4: &ldquo;newness of life&rdquo;; Col 3:9-10: &ldquo;put off the old self, &hellip; have put on the new self&rdquo;). <br>5) </span><span class="c3">practical purity</span><span>&nbsp;is the hard part that </span><span class="c3">does</span><span>&nbsp;require our supreme effort. This is why Paul implores us to &ldquo;cleanse ourselves from all defilement, perfecting holiness&rdquo; (2 Cor 7:1). We are not just saved for future heavenly purity, but also for present earthly purity. God wants us to be as pure as we can be, even though at best it will be gold mixed with clay, a spotted white garment. If purity does not characterize our living, we either do not belong to Christ, or we are disobedient to Him. We will have temptations, but God will always provide a way of escape (1 Cor 10:13). We will fall into sin, but &ldquo;if we confess our sins, He .. will forgive and cleanse us&rdquo; (1 John 1:9). <br>6) Finally, we will experience </span><span class="c3">ultimate purity</span><span class="c4">, the perfected purity that God&rsquo;s redeemed people will experience when they are glorified in His presence. <br>(MacArthur)</span></p><p class="c2"><span>5:8: (</span><span class="c1">the way to holiness</span><span class="c4">) Throughout the history of the church people tried to achieve spiritual purity through monasticism (getting away) or through seeing it as a second work of grace, a given spiritual gift. Neither Scripture nor experience supports either of those views.<br>God always provides for what He demands, and He has provided ways for us to live purely. 1) we must realize that we are unable to live a single holy moment without the Lord&rsquo;s guidance and power. We cannot cleanse ourselves (Prov 20:9: &ldquo;Who can say, &ldquo;I have made my heart pure;I am clean from my sin&rdquo;?&ldquo;; Jer 13:23: &ldquo;Can the Ethiopian change his skin or the leopard his spots? Then also you can do good who are accustomed to do evil.&ldquo;). 2) we must stay in God&rsquo;s Word. It is impossible to say in God&rsquo;s will apart from His Word. 3) It is essential to be controlled by and walking in the will and way of the Holy Spirit (Gal 5:16: &ldquo;walk by the Spirit, and you will not gratify the desires of the flesh.&rdquo;). 4) We must pray. We cannot stay in God&rsquo;s will or understand and obey His word unless we stay near Him. Eph 6:18: &ldquo;with all prayer and petition&hellip; pray at all times in the Spirit&rdquo;. </span></p><p class="c2"><span>5:8: (</span><span class="c1">the logical sequence and progression of beatitudes</span><span class="c4">) At first glance this beatitude seems out of place, but it actually is the climax of the Beatitudes, the central truth to which the previous five lead and from which the following two flow.<br>(MacArthur)</span></p><p class="c2"><span>5:8: (</span><span class="c1">the result of holiness</span><span>) The great </span><span class="c0">blessing</span><span>&nbsp;of those who are pure in heart is that </span><span class="c0">they shall see God</span><span>. The Greek literally says &ldquo;they shall be continuously seeing God for themselves&rdquo;, </span><span class="c0">they</span><span>&nbsp;and </span><span class="c3">only</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span class="c0">they</span><span>&nbsp;(the emphatic </span><span class="c3">autos</span><span class="c4">). Intimate knowledge of and fellowship with God is reserved for the pure. <br>When our hearts are purified at salvation we begin to live in the presence of God. We begin to see and to comprehend Him with our new spiritual eyes. Purity of heart cleanses the eyes of the sould so that God becomes visible. <br>One sign of an impure heart is ignorance, because sin obscures the truth. Other signs of an impure heart are self-centeredness, pleasure in sin, unbelief, and hatred of purity. Those who belong to God exchange all of those things for integrity and purity.<br>(MacArthur)</span></p><p class="c2 c10"><span class="c4"></span></p><h4 class="c25" id="h.mquvw18cfu6v"><span class="c15 c0">&ldquo;Blessed are the peacemakers, for they shall be called sons of God.</span></h4><p class="c2"><span>5:9: </span><span class="c0">be called the sons of God</span><span class="c4">: express his character (AMP)</span></p><p class="c2"><span>5:9: &#1041;&#1099;&#1090;&#1100; </span><span class="c0">&#1084;&#1080;&#1088;&#1086;&#1090;&#1074;&#1086;&#1088;&#1094;&#1077;&#1084;</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&#1086;&#1079;&#1085;&#1072;&#1095;&#1072;&#1077;&#1090; &#1087;&#1086;&#1089;&#1090;&#1091;&#1087;&#1072;&#1090;&#1100; &#1076;&#1088;&#1091;&#1078;&#1077;&#1083;&#1102;&#1073;&#1085;&#1086; &#1080; &#1085;&#1077; &#1087;&#1086;&#1076;&#1072;&#1074;&#1072;&#1090;&#1100; &#1087;&#1086;&#1074;&#1086;&#1076;&#1072; &#1082; &#1088;&#1072;&#1079;&#1085;&#1086;&#1075;&#1083;&#1072;&#1089;&#1080;&#1102;; &#1074;&#1086;&#1079;&#1085;&#1080;&#1082;&#1096;&#1077;&#1077; &#1088;&#1072;&#1079;&#1085;&#1086;&#1075;&#1083;&#1072;&#1089;&#1080;&#1077; &#1087;&#1088;&#1077;&#1082;&#1088;&#1072;&#1097;&#1072;&#1090;&#1100; &#1074;&#1089;&#1077;&#1084;&#1080; &#1089;&#1088;&#1077;&#1076;&#1089;&#1090;&#1074;&#1072;&#1084;&#1080;, &#1076;&#1072;&#1078;&#1077; &#1087;&#1086;&#1089;&#1090;&#1091;&#1087;&#1072;&#1103;&#1089;&#1100; &#1089;&#1074;&#1086;&#1080;&#1084;&#1080; &#1080;&#1085;&#1090;&#1077;&#1088;&#1077;&#1089;&#1072;&#1084;&#1080;, &#1077;&#1089;&#1083;&#1080; &#1090;&#1086;&#1083;&#1100;&#1082;&#1086; &#1101;&#1090;&#1086; &#1085;&#1077; &#1087;&#1088;&#1086;&#1090;&#1080;&#1074;&#1086;&#1088;&#1077;&#1095;&#1080;&#1090; &#1076;&#1086;&#1083;&#1075;&#1091; &#1080; &#1085;&#1080;&#1082;&#1086;&#1084;&#1091; &#1085;&#1077; &#1074;&#1088;&#1077;&#1076;&#1080;&#1090;; &#1089;&#1090;&#1072;&#1088;&#1072;&#1090;&#1100;&#1089;&#1103; &#1087;&#1088;&#1080;&#1084;&#1080;&#1088;&#1103;&#1090;&#1100; &#1084;&#1077;&#1078;&#1076;&#1091; &#1089;&#1086;&#1073;&#1086;&#1081; &#1074;&#1088;&#1072;&#1078;&#1076;&#1091;&#1102;&#1097;&#1080;&#1093;, &#1072; &#1077;&#1089;&#1083;&#1080; &#1090;&#1072;&#1082;&#1086;&#1081; &#1074;&#1086;&#1079;&#1084;&#1086;&#1078;&#1085;&#1086;&#1089;&#1090;&#1080; &#1085;&#1077;&#1090;, &#1090;&#1086; &#1084;&#1086;&#1083;&#1080;&#1090;&#1100; &#1041;&#1086;&#1075;&#1072; &#1086;&#1073; &#1080;&#1093; &#1087;&#1088;&#1080;&#1084;&#1080;&#1088;&#1077;&#1085;&#1080;&#1080;.

Although the peace of earth in the garden was interrupted when man sinned, at the cross Jesus Chrsit made peace a reality again, and He becomes the peace of all who place their faith in Him. Peace can now reign in the hearts of those who are His. It is the inner personal peace that only God can give to the soul of man and that only His children can exemplify. (MacArthur) </span></p><p class="c2"><span>5:9: (</span><span class="c1">The modern situation concerning peace</span><span>) The scarcity of </span><span class="c0">peace</span><span>&nbsp;has prompted someone to suggest that &ldquo;</span><span class="c0">peace</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;is that glorious moment in history when everyone stops to reload&rdquo;. Our world is not characterized by peace: since 1945 there have been some 70 or so wars and nearly 200 internationally significant outbreaks of violence. We do not have economic peace, religious peace, racial peace, social peace, family peace, or personal peace.<br>Nor does the world honor peace: our heroes are powerful and often destructive, the model man is not meek but macho, the model hero is not self-giving but self-seeking, not generous but selfish, not gentle but cruel, not submissive but aggressive, not meek but proud. <br>The popular philosophy of the world is to put self first; but when self is first, peace is last. Self precipitates strife, division, hatred, resentment and war. It is the great ally of sin and the great enemy of righteousness and, consequently, of peace.<br>(MacArthur)</span></p><p class="c2"><span>5:9: (</span><span class="c1">God&rsquo;s peace is unlike world&rsquo;s peace</span><span>) This seventh beatitude calls God&rsquo;s people to be </span><span class="c0">peacemakers</span><span class="c4">. He has called us to a special mission to help restore the peace lost at the Fall. This peace of which Christ speaks is unlike that which the world knows and strives for: it has nothing to do with politics, compromise, negotiations or treaties. <br>God&rsquo;s peace never evades issues; it knows nothing of peace at any price, it does not gloss or hide, rationalize or excuse. It confronts problems and seeks to solve them, and after the problems are solved, it builds a bridge between those who were separated by the problems. It often brings its own struggle, pain, hardship, and anguish, because such are often the price of healing. (MacArthur)</span></p><p class="c2"><span>5:9: (</span><span class="c1">the meaning of peace</span><span>) The essential fact to comprehend is that the </span><span class="c0">peace</span><span>&nbsp;about which Jesus speaks is more than the absence of conflict and strife; it is the presence of righteousness. Only righteousness can produce the relationship that brings two parties together. Men can stop fighting without righteousness, but they cannot live peaceably without righteousness. Until disagreements and hatreds are resolved, truce is seldom more than a cold war: the conflicts merely go underground where they tend to fester, grow, and break out again. Righteousness not only puts an end to harm, but it administers the healing of love, it brings harmony and true well-being. God&rsquo;s peace not only stops the hostilities but settles the issues and brings the parties together in mutual love and harmony.<br>The Jewish greeting </span><span class="c3">shalom</span><span>&nbsp;wishes &ldquo;</span><span class="c0">peace</span><span>&rdquo;, wishes all the righteousness and goodness God can give. The deepest meaning of </span><span class="c3">shalom</span><span>&nbsp;is &ldquo;God&rsquo;s highest good to you&rdquo;.<br>James confirms the nature of this God&rsquo;s </span><span class="c0">peace</span><span>: &ldquo;But the wisdom from above is first pure, then peaceable&rdquo; (Jas 3:17). God&rsquo;s way to peace is through purity. Peace cannot be obtained at the expense of righteousness. Two people cannot be at peace unless they recognize and resolve the wrong attitudes and actions that caused the conflict between them, and then bring themselves to God for cleansing. Peace that ignores the cleansing is not God&rsquo;s peace. Peace cannot be divorced from holiness.<br>The person who is not willing to disrupt and disturb in God&rsquo;s name cannot be a </span><span class="c0">peacemaker</span><span class="c4">. To come to terms on anything less than God&rsquo;s truth and righteousness is to settle for a truce &mdash; which confirms sinners in their sin and may leave them even further from the kingdom. Being a peacemaker is essentially the result of a holy life and the call to others to embrace the gospel of holiness.<br>(MacArthur)</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c18">5:9: &#1087;&#1077;&#1088;&#1077;&#1074;&#1086;&#1076;

His meaning was that the peace He came to bring is not peace at any price; there will be opposition before there is harmony, there will be strife before there is peace. To be peacemakers on God&rsquo;s terms requires being peacemakers on the terms of truth and righteousness &mdash; to which the world is in fierce opposition. When believers set God&rsquo;s standards of righteousness before a world that loves wickedness, there is an inevitable potential for conflict. Yet that is the only way. (MacArthur)</span></p><p class="c2"><span>5:9: (</span><span class="c1">believers are messengers of peace</span><span>) Men are without peace because they are without God, who is the source of </span><span class="c0">peace</span><span>. God is the maker of </span><span class="c0">peace</span><span class="c4">; the believers are the messengers of His peace. Only those who belong to the Maker of peace can be messengers of peace. Those whom God has called to peace He also calls to make peace.<br>Paul says that in Christ God &ldquo;has reconciled (made peace) the world to Himself&rdquo;, and we are His &ldquo;ambassadors&rdquo;, entrusted with &ldquo;the message of reconciliation&rdquo; (2 Cor 5:18-20). Reconciliation, that is, peace. (MacArthur)</span></p><p class="c2"><span>5:9: (</span><span class="c1">characteristics of a peacemaker</span><span>) <br>1) He is one who himself made </span><span class="c0">peace</span><span>&nbsp;with God. No matter what we may consciously have thought about God, out hearts were against Him, we were at war with God, &ldquo;we were enemies&rdquo; of God that &ldquo;were reconciled&rdquo; to Him (Rom 5:10). When we received CHrist as Savior and He imputed His righteousness to us, our battle with God ended, and our peace with God began. <br>2) Because </span><span class="c0">peace</span><span>&nbsp;is always corrupted by sin, the peacemaking believer must be a holy believer, a believer whose life is continually cleansed by the Holy Spirit. The disobedient, self-indulgent Christian is not suited to be an ambassador of peace. <br>3) A </span><span class="c0">peacemaker</span><span>&nbsp;leads others to make peace with God. Christians are not elite corps of those who have spiritually arrived and who look down on the rest of the world. They are a body of sinners cleansed by Jesus Christ and commissioned to carry His gospel of cleansing to the rest of the world. <br>4) The </span><span class="c0">peacemaking</span><span>&nbsp;spirit is based on humility, sorrow over its own sin, gentleness, hunger for righteousness, mercy, and purity of heart (the other beatitudes). The peacemaker is a beggar who had been fed and who is called to help feed others. Having been brought to God, he is to bring others to God. To bring a person to saving knowledge of Jesus Christ is the most peacemaking act a human being can perform. <br>5) A </span><span class="c0">peacemaker</span><span>&nbsp;helps others make peace with others. He builds bridges between men and God and also between men and other men. It starts with building bridges between ourselves and others. Jesus says to &ldquo;be reconciled to your brother&rdquo; before coming to the altar (Mt 5:23-24); Paul says to be &ldquo;so far as it depends on us, be at peace with all men&rdquo; (Rom 12:18). We are even to &ldquo;Love your enemies and pray for those who persecute&rdquo; us, &ldquo;so that you may be sons of your Father who is in heaven&rdquo; (Mt 5:44-45). <br>By definition a bridge needs support from both sides. So in any relationship we are to see that our own side has a solid base, and it is also our responsibility to help the one on the other side build his base well. Both sides must be built on righteousness and truth, or the bridge will not stand. God&rsquo;s peacemakers must first be righteous themselves, and then must be active in helping others become righteous.<br>The first step in that bridge-building process is often to rebuke others about their sin, which is the supreme barrier to peace. &ldquo;If your brother sins, go and reprove him in private&rdquo; (Mt 18:15-17). If we do so in the way and in the spirit the Lord teaches, the consequences are His responsibility. There may be a price to pay, but any sacrifice is small in order to obey God. Not to do so does not preserve peace but through disobedience establishes a truce with sin. And the only way to peace is the way of righteousness. Sin that is not dealt with is sin that will disrupt and destroy peace.<br>6) A </span><span class="c0">peacemaker</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;endeavors to find a point of agreement. Wrong theology, wrong standards, wrong beliefs, and wrong attitudes must be faced and dealt with, but they are not usually the best places to start the process of witnessing or peacemaking. God&rsquo;s people are to contend without being contentions, to disagree without being disagreeable, and to confront without being abusive. The peacemaker speaks the truth in love (Eph 4:15). To start with love is to start toward peace. We begin peacemaking by starting with whatever peaceful point of agreement we can find. The peacemaker always gives others the benefit of the doubt: he never assumes they will resist the gospel or reject his testimony. When he does meet opposition, he tries to be patient with other people&rsquo;s blindness and stubbornness just as he knows the Lord was, and continues to be, patient with his own blindness and stubbornness.<br>(MacArthur)</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c27">5:9: &#1087;&#1077;&#1088;&#1077;&#1074;&#1086;&#1076;: (</span><span class="c1 c27">&#1061;&#1072;&#1088;&#1072;&#1082;&#1090;&#1077;&#1088;&#1080;&#1089;&#1090;&#1080;&#1082;&#1080;

As God&rsquo;s peacemakers, we are promised the glorious blessing of eternal sonship in His eternal kingdom.<br>Peacemaking is a hallmark of God&rsquo;s children.

Persecution is not limited to those outside the church; it can come from within through hypocrites, false brothers, and the spiritually immature. One mark of a false Christian is his doctrine as it affects persecution. He will look, sound, and act very religious, but will compromise truth quickly to appear peaceful and inclusive of others. He will try to appear </span><span class="c3">reasonable</span><span>&nbsp;and avoid issues, and call true Christians troublemakers.</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;(John Strohman)</span></p><p class="c2"><span>5:10: The kingdom of the world rejects those who are </span><span class="c0">righteous</span><span>, but </span><span class="c0">the kingdom of heaven</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;is theirs instead.</span></p><p class="c2"><span>5:10: (</span><span class="c1">worldly happiness vs godly happiness</span><span>) According to a survey, people would enjoy other people but are not self-sacrificing; they refuse to participate in any negative experiences; and they have a sense of accomplishment based on their self-sufficiency. The world does not associate happiness with humility, mourning over sin, gentleness, righteousness, mercy, purity of heart, or peacemaking holiness. Even less does it associate happiness with persecution.<br>Jesus says a </span><span class="c0">blessed</span><span>&nbsp;person is the one who recognizes his own emptiness and need, who comes to God as a beggar, knowing he has not resources in himself. He is not confident in his own ability but is very much aware of his own inability. Such a person is not at all positive about himself but mourns over his own sinfulness and isolation from a holy God. To be genuinely content, a person must not be self-serving but self-sacrificing. He must be gentle, merciful, pure in heart, yearn for righteousness, and seek to make peace on God&rsquo;s terms &mdash; even if those attitudes cause him to suffer.<br>The Lord&rsquo;s opening thrust climaxes with this great and sobering truth: those who faithfully live according to the beatitudes will inevitably be persecuted for it. Godliness generates hostility and antagonism from the world. The crowning feature of the happy person is persecution! Kingdom people are rejected people. Holy people a singularly </span><span class="c0">blessed</span><span class="c4">, but they pay a price for it.<br>(MacArthur)</span></p><p class="c2"><span>5:10: (</span><span class="c1">the persecution</span><span>) </span><span class="c0">Those who have been persecuted</span><span>&nbsp;are the citizens of the kingdom, those who live out the previous seven beatitudes. To the degree that they fulfill the first seven they may experience the eighth. &ldquo;All who desire to live a godly life in Christ Jesus will be persecuted&rdquo; (2 Tim 3:12). &ldquo;...these afflictions &hellip;, we are destined for this&rdquo; (1 Thess 3:3-4).<br>To live for Christ is to live in opposition to satan in his world and in his system. Those born only of the flesh will persecute those born of the Spirit. Righteousness is confrontational: it confronts wickeness by its very contrast, if not by spoken word. Abel did not preach to Cain, but Abel&rsquo;s righteous life, typified by his proper sacrifice to the Lord, was a constant rebuke to his wicked brother.<br>Persecution is one of the surest and most tangible evidences of salvation. Ridicule, criticism, resentment and rejection is part of the normal Christian life. We must be willing to endure whatever trouble our faithfulness to Jesus Christ may bring, and to see it as a confirmation of true salvation.<br>Some costs will be great and some will be slight. Faithfulness always has a cot, which true Christians are willing to pay.<br>A man once approached Tertullian and asked, &ldquo;I have come to Christ, but I don&rsquo;t think that my job is consistent with what Scripture teaches. What can I do? I must live.&rdquo;. To that, Tertullian replied, &ldquo;Must you?&rdquo;. Loyalty to Christ is the Christian&rsquo;s only true choice. To be prepared for kingdom life is to be prepared for loneliness, misunderstanding, ridicule, rejection, and unfair treatment of every sort. <br>Jesus is not speaking of every hardship, problem, or conflict believers may face, but those that the world brings on us </span><span class="c3">because of</span><span>&nbsp;our faithfulness to the Lord.</span><span class="c4"><br>(MacArthur)</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c4">5:10: &ldquo;Though they be never so meek, merciful, pure in heart, their piety will not shield them from sufferings.

The hallmark of the </span><span class="c0">blessed</span><span>&nbsp;person is </span><span class="c0">righteousness</span><span class="c4">; holy living is what provokes persecution of God&rsquo;s people. When we are hated, the real animosity is not against us but against Christ. Satan&rsquo;s great enemy is Christ, and he opposes us because He is in us. When we are despised and attacked by the world, the real target is the rigtheousness for which we snand and which we exemplify. <br>That is why it is easy to escape persecution: the world will accept us if we are willing to compromise our beliefs and standards and put some distance between ourselves and the Lord&rsquo;s righteousness. &ldquo;If you were of the world, the world would love its own&rdquo; (Jn 15:19) <br>(MacArthur)</span></p><p class="c2"><span>5:10: (</span><span class="c1">avoiding persecution by compromise</span><span>) The way to avoid </span><span class="c0">persecution</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;is easy: &ldquo;live and let live&rdquo;. Mimic the world&rsquo;s standards; never criticize them; keep quiet about the gospel, especially the truth that apart from its saving power men remain in their sins and are destined to hell; laugh at its jokes, let it mock God and be ashamed to take a stand for Christ. Those are the habits of sham Christians.<br>Jesus does not take faithlessness lightly: &ldquo;whoever is ashamed of me and of my words, of him will the Son of Man be ashamed&rdquo; (Lk 9:26). To be popular with everyone is to compromise the faith.<br>We live in a day when the church, more than ever before, is engaged in self-glorification and an attempt to gain worldly recognition that must be repulsive to God. When the church tries to use the things of the world to do the work of heaven, it only succeeds in hiding heaven from the world. And when the world is pleased with the church, we can be sure that God is not. We can be &nbsp;equally sure that when we are pleasing to God, we will not be pleasing to the system of satan.<br>(MacArthur)</span></p><p class="c2"><span>5:10: (</span><span class="c1">the promise</span><span>) Jesus pronounces a double </span><span class="c0">blessing</span><span>&nbsp;on those who are </span><span class="c0">persecuted for the sake of righteousness</span><span>, which is </span><span class="c0">for His own sake</span><span>. The specific blessing is that </span><span class="c0">theirs is the kingdom of heaven</span><span>. <br>I believe that the blessings of the </span><span class="c0">kingdom</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;are threefold: present, millennial, and eternal. &ldquo;Shall receive a hundred times as much now in the present age, &hellip; along with persecutions, &hellip; and in the age to come, evernal life&rdquo; (Mk 10:29-30)<br>(MacArthur)</span></p><p class="c2"><span>5:10: (</span><span class="c1">the logical sequence and progression of beatitudes</span><span>) The central theme of beatitudes is righteousness. The first two have to do with recognizing our own unrighteousness, and the next five have to do with our seeking and reflecting righteousness. The last beatitude has to do with our suffering </span><span class="c0">for the sake of righteousness</span><span class="c4">. (MacArthur)</span></p><p class="c2"><span>5:10: (</span><span class="c1">the worldly reaction to beatitudes</span><span class="c4">) The world cannot handle the righteous life that characterizes kingdom living. It is not understandable and acceptable to them, and they cannot stomach it even in others. Poverty of spirit runs counter to the pride of unbelieving heart. The repentant, contrite disposition that mourns over sin in never appreciated by the callous, indifferent, unsympathetic world. The meek and quiet spirit that takes wrong and does not strike back is regarded as pusillanimous (showing lack of courage and determination), and it rasps against the militant, vengeful spirit characteristic of the world. To long after righteousness is repugnant to those whose fleshly cravings are rebuked by it, as is a merciful spirit to those whose hearts are hard and cruel. Purity of heart is a painful light that exposes hypocrisy and corruption, and peacemaking is a virtue praised by the contentious, self-seeking world in words but not in heart. <br>(MacArthur)</span></p><p class="c2"><span>5:11: </span><span class="c0">When</span><span>&nbsp;(Gk. </span><span class="c3">hotan</span><span>) can also mean whenever: whenever opposition, ridicule, or persecution comes, we should not be surprised or resentful. Jesus was not </span><span class="c3">constantly</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;opposed: there were times of peace and even popularity. (MacArthur)</span></p><p class="c2"><span>5:12: (</span><span class="c1">be active</span><span>) The believer&rsquo;s response to persecution should not be to retreat and hide. To escape from the world is to escape responsibility. <br>We are no longer </span><span class="c3">of</span><span>&nbsp;this world, but He has sent us </span><span class="c3">into</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;this world to serve, just as Christ came to serve. His followers are &ldquo;the salt of the earth&rdquo; and the &ldquo;light of the world&rdquo; (vv. 13-14). For our salt to flavor the earth and our light to lighten the world we must be active in the world. The gospel is not to be hidden but to enlighten: &ldquo;let your light shine before men&rdquo; (vv. 15-16). Our salt will sting the world&rsquo;s open wounds of sin, and out light will irritate its eyes that are used to darkness. <br>(MacArthur)</span></p><p class="c2"><span>5:12: (</span><span class="c1">be glad</span><span>) Even when your salt and light are resented and rejected, we should </span><span class="c0">rejoice and be glad</span><span>. </span><span class="c0">Be glad</span><span>&nbsp;(Gk. </span><span class="c3">agalliao</span><span>) literally means to skip and jump with happy excitement, to exult and be overjoyed. The imperative mood makes it a command, not merely a suggestion: we are </span><span class="c3">commanded</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span class="c0">to be glad</span><span class="c4">. Not to be glad when we suffer for Christ&rsquo;s sake is to be untrusting and disobedient.<br>The world can take away a great deal from God&rsquo;s people, but it cannot take away their joy. We know that nothing the world can do to us is permanent.<br>(MacArthur)</span></p><p class="c2"><span>5:12: (</span><span class="c1">the reward</span><span>) Whatever we do for the Lord now, including suffering for Him, reaps eternal dividends: </span><span class="c0">your reward is great in heaven</span><span>. They are not only eternal but are also </span><span class="c0">great</span><span class="c4">, for God &ldquo;is able to do far more abundantly than all that we ask or think&rdquo; (Eph 3:20). <br>We serve and obey Christ first of all because we love Him, but secondly, it&rsquo;s neither selfish nor unscriptural to do the Lord&rsquo;s work for a motive that He Himself gives and has followed: for the reward.<br>(MacArthur)</span></p><p class="c2 c10"><span class="c4"></span></p><h4 class="c25" id="h.d80hgrz59fql"><span class="c15 c0">Salt and Light</span></h4><p class="c2"><span>5:13: </span><span class="c0">Salt</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;is a flavoring, and a preservative.

(John Strohman)</span></p><p class="c2"><span>5:13-14: We are no longer of this world, but He has sent us into this world to serve, just as Christ came to serve.

(John Strohman)</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c4">5:13: Thought Jesus was speaking before a great multitude, this teaching was primarily for His disciples. The principles He teaches are appropriate only for believers, for they are impossible to follow apart from the power of God&rsquo;s own Spirit. (MacArthur)</span></p><p class="c2"><span>5:13-16: (</span><span class="c1">influence</span><span>) </span><span>In these four verses, the Lord summarizes the function of believers in the world. Reduced to one word, that function is </span><span class="c3">influence</span><span class="c4">. <br>Christian character consciously or unconsciously affects other people for better or for worse. As John Donne reminds us, &ldquo;No man is an island&rdquo;. Elihu Burritt wrote, &ldquo;No human being can come into this world without increasing or diminishing the sum total of human happiness, not only of the present, but of every subsequent age of humanity. No one can detach himself from this connection.&rdquo;. <br>Christ&rsquo;s kingdom people are not to reflect the world (1 Jn 2:15: &ldquo;do not love the world, nor the things of the world&rdquo;), but they are to influence the world. They are to be in it, but not of it.<br>When we live the Beatitudes out, some people will respond and be saved, others will ridicule and persecute us. &ldquo;For we are the aroma of Christ: &hellip; to one a fragrance from death to death, to the other a fragrance from life to life.&rdquo; (2 Cor 2:15-16). We are &ldquo;a chosen race, a royal priesthood &hellip; that may proclaim the excellencies of Him Who has called &hellip; into light&rdquo; (1 Pet 2:9). The world has no other way of knowing God except through the testimony of what we are.<br>(MacArthur)</span></p><p class="c2"><span>5:13-16: (</span><span class="c1">corruption and darkness</span><span>) The presupposition is that the world needs </span><span class="c0">salt</span><span>&nbsp;because it is corrupt, and that it needs </span><span class="c0">light</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;because it is dark. (MacArthur)</span></p><p class="c2"><span>5:13-14: (</span><span class="c1">the effect of salt and light</span><span>) We are God&rsquo;s </span><span class="c0">salt</span><span>&nbsp;to retard corruption (salt is a preservative), and His </span><span class="c0">light</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;to reveal truth. One function is negative, the other positive. One is silent, the other is verbal. By the indirect influence we retard corruption, and by the direct influence of what we say we manifest light. <br>Both salt and light are unlike that which they are to influence. God has changed us from being part of the corrupted and corrupting world to being salt that can help preserve it; He has changed us from our own darkness to be His agents of giving light to others. The influence is different from that which it influences.<br>(MacArthur)</span></p><p class="c2"><span>5:13-14: The pronoun </span><span class="c0">you</span><span>&nbsp;in both verses is emphatic, saying, &ldquo;</span><span class="c3">only</span><span>&nbsp;you&rdquo;: &ldquo;you are the only </span><span class="c0">salt</span><span>, you are the only </span><span class="c0">light</span><span>&rdquo;. The &ldquo;</span><span class="c0">you</span><span>&rdquo; in both verses is also plural: it is His whole body, the church, that is called to be the world&rsquo;s </span><span class="c0">salt and light</span><span class="c4">. Each grain of salt has its limited influence, but it is only as the church collectively is scattered in the world that change will come. (MacArthur)</span></p><p class="c2"><span>5:13: (</span><span class="c1">the value of salt</span><span>) Salt has been more valuable than it is today. In ancient Greece, it was called </span><span class="c3">theon</span><span>, which means divine. For Romans, nothing was more valuable than salt. Often Roman soldiers were paid in salt, and it was from that practice that the expression &ldquo;not worth his salt&rdquo; originated.<br>In many societies, salt was a mark of friendship: even if a worst enemy ate salt with you, you were obliged to treat him as a friend. It was also used when making a covenant, even in the OT (2 Chr 13:5: covenant of salt with David; Lev 2:13: offerings with salt).<br>When people heard this </span><span class="c0">salt</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;metaphor, they knew that His followers were to have an extremely important function in the world. Salt always stood for that which was of high value and importance.<br>(MacArthur)</span></p><p class="c2"><span>5:13: The meaning of </span><span class="c0">salt</span><span>. </span><span class="c13">1) </span><span class="c0 c13">salt</span><span class="c13">&nbsp;is white and therefore represents purity; it contrasts with the moral discolor of the world. True, but not the point, because saltiness, not the color, is the issue. 2) Just as many foods are tasteless without salt, the world is drab and tasteless without the presence of Christians that add divine flavor to the world. The problem with this view is that in the world&rsquo;s eyes, Christians actually take the flavor </span><span class="c3 c13">out of</span><span class="c13">&nbsp;life, being stifling and restrictive. 3) Because salt stings when placed in a wound, Christians are to sting the world, prick its conscience, make it uncomfortable in the presence of God&rsquo;s holy gospel. To confront people with their lostness and their desperate need to be saved from their sin. 4) Salt creates thirst. God intends for HIs people so to live and testify before the world that others will be made more aware of their spiritual dehydration and danger. A person may see our peace in a trying circumstance, and thereby be persuaded to try our faith. </span><span class="c4"><br>I believe the primary characteristic Jesus emphasizes is that of preservation: Christians are a preserving influence that retards moral and spiritual spoilage. Once God&rsquo;s people are removed it will take only seven years for the world to descend to the very pits of hellishness (2 Thess 2:7: &ldquo;Only he who now restrains [lawlessness] it will do so until he is out of the way.&rdquo;; Dan 9:27: one week). <br>(MacArthur)</span></p><p class="c2"><span>5:13: Much salt in Palestine was contaminated with gypsum that make its taste flat and even repulsive. When such contaminated salt was found in a household, it was thrown out &mdash; but not on a garden, where it would kill the plants; instead, it would be thrown onto a road where it would gradually be </span><span class="c0">trampled</span><span>&nbsp;into dirt and disappear. <br>There is a way in which salt cannot really become unsalty; but it can become contaminated and lose its value as salt. Its saltiness can no longer function.<br>Jesus is not speaking of losing salvation; Christians can lose their value and effectiveness in the kingdom when sin and worldliness contaminate their lives, just as </span><span class="c0">salt</span><span>&nbsp;can </span><span class="c0">become tasteless</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;when contaminated by other minerals. &nbsp;<br>(MacArthur)</span></p><p class="c2"><span>5:14: The meaning of </span><span class="c0">light</span><span>. While salt works secretly, </span><span class="c0">light</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;works openly. Salt works from within, light works from without. Salt works indirectly, through our living; light works directly, primarily through what we teach and preach. Salt retards but does not change; but the light can reveal and change.<br>Christ is the true light, and we are His reflections. He is the Sun, and we are His moons. &nbsp;God sheds His light on the world through those who have received His light through Jesus Christ. (MacArthur)</span></p><p class="c2"><span>5:14: By its nature </span><span class="c0">light</span><span>&nbsp;must be visible in order to illuminate. Christians must be the direct and noticeable instruments of light. Both in the daytime and at night, </span><span class="c0">a city set on a hill cannot be hidden</span><span class="c4">: by day its buildings stand out on the landscape, and at night the many lights shining out of its windows make it impossible to miss. (MacArthur)</span></p><p class="c2"><span>5:15: A secret Christian is as incongruous as a </span><span class="c0">hidden light</span><span class="c4">. Lights are to illuminate, not to be hidden. A hidden light is useless light. Whether we hide our light because of fear of offending others, because of indifference and lovelessness, or because of anything else, we demonstrate unfaithfulness to the Lord. (MacArthur)</span></p><p class="c2"><span>5:16: Even though the </span><span class="c0">Father </span><span>is</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;in Heaven</span><span>, people who are on earth can know His qualities by what they see in His people. The </span><span class="c0">good works</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;they do manifest the character of God.</span></p><p class="c2"><span>5:16: The purpose of being </span><span class="c0">salt </span><span>and </span><span class="c0">light</span><span>&nbsp;is to </span><span class="c0">glorify the Father</span><span>. When we do </span><span class="c0">good works</span><span class="c4">, they reveal the beauty the Lord has worked in us. To see the good works by us is to see Christ in us. Those good works is not something we create, but something we allow the Lord to do through us. This is the supreme calling of life: glorifying God. Everything we do is to cause others to give praise to the God who is the source of all that is good.<br>But when what we do causes people to be attracted to us rather than to God, to see our human character rather than His divine character, we can be sure that what they see is not His light.

Next, He showed its permanence, its lasting without the smallest change or reduction. Then, He showed its pertinence: citizens of the kingdom are still under the full requirements of the OT law and are not to diminish or disobey it. (MacArthur)</span></p><p class="c2"><span>5:17-20: (</span><span class="c1">the flow of the Sermon on the Mount</span><span class="c4">) Like Beatitudes, every teaching flows out of the preceding one. The Beatitudes (vv. 3-12) depict the character of believers, who are kingdom citizens and children of God. The Salt and Light (vv. 13-16) teach the function of believers in a corrupt and darkened world. The Law verses (vv. 17-20) teach the foundation for the inner qualities and the function of believers: God&rsquo;s Word, the only standard of righteousness and truth. (MacArthur)</span></p><p class="c2"><span>5:17: (</span><span class="c1">relative morals</span><span class="c4">) A consistent, coherent legal system cannot be built on the principle that right and wrong fluctuate according to man&rsquo;s ideas and feelings. There has to be an absolute, a global standard, and that standard used to be religion. Now, when religion and law are increasingly being decoupled, our &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;culture experiences a massive loss of confidence in both law and religion. A godless society, floating on the sea of relativism, realizes that it has no foundation, no anchor, no unmoving point of reference. (MacArthur)</span></p><p class="c2"><span>5:17: (</span><span class="c1">Bible is outdated</span><span>) We continually hear the idea that because times have changed, the Bible does not fit our day. The truth, of course, is the opposite. The Bible always fits, because the Bible is God&rsquo;s perfect, eternal, and infallible Word. It is the standard by which true &ldquo;fit&rdquo; is measured. It is the world that does not fit the Bible; and not because the world has changed, but because the Bible has </span><span class="c3">not</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;changed. Outwardly the world has changed a great deal since biblical days, but in its basic nature and orientation is has always been opposed to God and has never conformed to His Word. The world has never fit Scripture. (MacArthur)</span></p><p class="c2"><span>5:17: (</span><span class="c1">Jesus did not identify with any school</span><span class="c4">) Jesus did not identify Himself with any of the scribal schools, or with any of the sects or movements of the time. Nor did He identify Himself with Herod or with Rome. Instead, Jesus openly and lovingly identified Himself with the outcast, the sick, the sinful, and then eedy of every sort. He proclaimed grace and dispensed mercy. Whereas all the other rabbis and religious leaders talked only about the religious externals, He taught about the heart. They focused on ceremonies, rituals, and outward acts of every kind, whereas he focused on the heart. They set themselves above other men and demanded their service, while He set Himself below other men and became their Servant. (MacArthur)</span></p><p class="c2"><span>5:17: (</span><span class="c1">The Messiah was expected to change the Law</span><span>) of primary concern to every faithful Jew seeking to evaluate Jesus was, &ldquo;What does He think of the </span><span class="c0">Law</span><span>, of Moses</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;and the prophets</span><span>?&rdquo;. The leaders often confronted Jesus with matters of the Law.<br>Many Jews believed that </span><span class="c3">the Messiah would radically revise, or completely overturn the Mosaic law</span><span>&nbsp; and establish His own new standards: they interpreted Jer 31:31 (&ldquo;the days are coming ... when I will make a new covenant&rdquo;) as teaching that God&rsquo;s new covenant would annul (</span><span class="c0">&ldquo;abolish&rdquo;</span><span>) the old covenant and start over on a completely new moral basis (Jer 31:32: &ldquo;not like the covenant that I made with their fathers&rdquo;).<br>For the Pharisees, whose teaching was essentially based on a </span><span class="c3">God&rsquo;s standard reduced</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; to a level that humans could keep, Jesus fit none of the common molds: He obviously had a high regard for the law, His teachings did not lower scriptural standards, but He taught contrary to the traditions and upheld the Law in every way. He put God&rsquo;s standard at the height where it belonged, and He Himself lived at that humanly impossible level. (MacArthur)</span></p><p class="c2"><span>5:17: (</span><span class="c1">external and internal obedience</span><span>) Many Jews understood &ldquo;</span><span class="c0">the Law</span><span class="c4">&rdquo; as the rabbinical and scribal traditions, which actually &ldquo;invalidated the Word of God&rdquo; (Mt 15:6) in the way it was written. On the surface, it seemed hard; in reality, it was entirely external, demanding no heart obedience and no faith in God.<br>God&rsquo;s law had always required inward as well as outward obedience (Isa 29:13: they &ldquo;honor Me with their lips, while their hearts are far from Me&ldquo;). &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c2"><span>5:17: (the impression of doing away with the law) Jesus, however, did not scrupulously follow the rabbinic traditions, which most Jews thought to be proper interpretations of the law of Moses, so Jessu was seen by some as </span><span class="c0">doing away with the Law</span><span>. Jesus&rsquo; warning, </span><span class="c0">do not think</span><span class="c4">, indicates that most of His hearers had a wrong conception about His teaching. <br>(MacArthur)</span></p><p class="c2"><span>5:17: </span><span class="c0">Abolish </span><span>(Gk. </span><span class="c3">kataluo</span><span class="c4">): to utterly overthrow or destroy. Same word used of the destruction of the Temple, of the death of the physical body. The basic idea is to tear down and smash, to obliterate completely; figuratively: to bring to naught, to render useless, nullify. (MacArthur)</span></p><p class="c2"><span>5:17: </span><span class="c0">the Law</span><span>: by using a definite article (</span><span class="c0">the</span><span>), Jesus made clear He spoke about </span><span class="c3">the </span><span class="c4">Law of God. (MacArthur)</span></p><p class="c2"><span>5:17: (</span><span class="c1">rabbinical law elaborated the Scripture</span><span class="c4">) During the Exile, and especially during the intertestamental period, the traditions were greatly multiplied and covered almost every conceivable activity a person could be involved in. <br>In elaborating scriptures, they went into great detail. For instance, concerning the Sabbath law, they decided that a &ldquo;burden&rdquo; is food equal to the weight of a fig, milk enough for one swallow, honey enough to put on a wound, paper enough to write a customs house notice, ink enough to write two letters of the alphabet, reed enough to make a pen, and so on and on. To carry anything more than those prescribed amounts on the Sabbath was to break the law.<br>Since it was not possible to anticipate every contingency, much time was spent arguing whether a tailor committed a sin if he went out on the Sabbath with a needle stuck in his robe, or whether moving a lamp from one place in a room to another was permissible. Some strict interpreters believed that even wearing an artificial leg or using a crutch or lifting a baby constituted work. They decided that to heal was work, but made exceptions for grave situations &shy;&mdash; but just enough treatment to keep the patient from getting worse was allowed.<br>(MacArthur)</span></p><p class="c2"><span>5:17: (</span><span class="c1">law accomplished by Christ</span><span>) Jesus came </span><span class="c0">to fulfill the Law</span><span>. In His incarnation; in the work of the Holy Spirit through the church; in His coming again, &mdash; Jesus would fulfill all of the Law: moral, judicial, and ceremonial. The word means to fill up; not to add, but to complete what is already present. Jesus did not add any basic new teaching but rather clarified God&rsquo;s original meaning. <br>First, Jesus </span><span class="c0">fulfilled the Law</span><span>&nbsp;by fully meeting its demands: He perfectly kept every part of the law. He was perfectly righteous and did not violate the smallest part of God&rsquo;s law. <br>But most importantly, Jesus </span><span class="c0">fulfilled the Law</span><span>&nbsp;by </span><span class="c3">being its fulfillment</span><span>. He did not simply teach; He </span><span class="c3">was</span><span>&nbsp;it fully; He did not come simply to teach righteousness, or to model righteousness; He came </span><span class="c3">as </span><span>divine righteousness. What He said and what He did reflected who He </span><span class="c3">is</span><span class="c4">. (MacArthur)</span></p><p class="c2"><span>5:17: (</span><span class="c1">Jesus fulfilled the ceremonial law</span><span class="c4">) The heart of all OT worship was sacrifice, and Jesus, as the perfect Sacrifice, brought all the other sacrifices to an end. While He was on the cross, the &ldquo;veil of the temple was torn in two&rdquo; (Mt 27:51), because Christ Himself was the new and perfect way into the Holy of Holies, into which any man could come by faith. (Heb 10:19-22: &ldquo;we have confidence to enter the holy place by the blood of Jesus, by new and living way&rdquo;).<br>Even before Christ, those sacrifices did not have the power to cleanse from sin; they were only pictures of the Messiah&rsquo;s work of cleansing. <br>(MacArthur)</span></p><p class="c2"><span>5:17: (</span><span class="c1">Jesus fulfilled the Sabbath</span><span class="c4">) The essence of Sabbath observance was holiness, not resting or refraining from work. It was a provision means to remove the heart from earthly endeavors and to turn it toward God. Because Christ fulfilled all righteousness and has become our righteousness, the purpose of Sabbath observance ended at the cross. Christians possess the reality, and so no longer need the symbol. All believers have entered into permanent salvation rest, as the writer of Hebrews carefully points out (4:1-11: believing Christians enter Sabbath rest, linked to divine rest on day 7). Every day becomes holy to the Lord.<br>In demonstration of that fact, the early church had thrit primary worship meetings held on the first day of the week (1 Cor 16:2: &ldquo;On the first day of every week, each of you is to put something aside and store it up&rdquo;; Acts 20:7: &ldquo;On the first day of the week, when we were gathered together to break bread&rdquo;) which came to be called &ldquo;the Lord&rsquo;s day&rdquo; because of its association with Jesus&rsquo; resurrection. That day was to stimulate them to holiness every other day as well (Heb 10:24-25: &ldquo;stir up one another to love and good works, 25 not neglecting to meet together&rdquo;). As Paul made clear, however, there is not longer any special day of worship (Rom 14:5-6: &ldquo; One person esteems one day as better than another, while another esteems all days alike&rdquo;; Col 2:16-17: &ldquo;let no judge ... in regard to a Sabbath. These are a shadow of the things to come&ldquo;). Worship on any day of the week is no less biblical or spiritual than worship on the Lord&rsquo;s day. Sunday is not the &ldquo;Christian Sabbath,&rdquo; as some claim, but is simply the day of worship most Christians have observed since NT times: a special time set aside for spiritual exercises.<br>(MacArthur)</span></p><p class="c2"><span>5:17: (</span><span class="c1">paradox: fulfilled or not?</span><span class="c4">) The Sermon on the Mount makes it absolutely clear that God&rsquo;s moral law did not cease at Christ&rsquo;s coming, but was reaffirmed, and remains energized by the Holy Spirit.<br>There is indeed a paradox, especially evident in Paul&rsquo;s letters: on one hand, we are told of the law&rsquo;s being fulfilled and done away with; and on the other, we are still obliged to obey it. <br>The ceremonial law also came to an end when the veil was torn in two, and when the Temple worship ended in A.D. 70. <br>So, what&rsquo;s in the end? We are no longer under the penalty of the law, but are far from free of its requirement of righteousness. We are not free from God&rsquo;s moral standards. The law was once our tutor, now leads us as &ldquo;sons of God&rdquo; (Gal 3:24,26) to be clothed with Christ, the source of our practical righteousness.<br>Paul harmonized the idea when he spoke of himself as being &ldquo;without the law of God but under the law of Christ&rdquo; (1 Cor 9:21). Christ&rsquo;s law is different from the OT law with its penalties and curses for disobedience, but it&rsquo;s not different in the slightest from the holy, righteous standards that the OT law taught.<br>The OT law is a moral guide, as in revealing sin (Rom 7:7: &ldquo;it had not been for the law, I would not have known sin. For I would not have known what it is to covet if the law had not said, &ldquo;You shall not covet.&rdquo;&rdquo;), even when it provokes sin (Rom 7:8), it helps us see the wickedness of our own flesh and our helplessness apart from Christ. Whenever a Christian looks at God&rsquo;s moral law with humility, meekness, and a sincere desire for righteousness, the law will invariably point him to Christ. <br>(MacArthur)</span></p><p class="c2"><span>5:18: </span><span class="c0">Truly I say to you</span><span>&nbsp;(lit. </span><span class="c0">amen I say to you</span><span>). Jesus confirmed the special importance of the statement that followed. Jesus was saying, &ldquo;I say this to you absolutely, without qualification and with the fullest authority.&rdquo; <br>His teaching not only was absolute, but was permanent: the law would outlast the universe, </span><span class="c0">until heaven and earth pass away</span><span>. Jesus even equated His own words (</span><span class="c0">my words</span><span class="c4">) with the Word of God in that both will not pass away. Jesus&rsquo; teaching is timeless.<br>(MacArthur)</span></p><p class="c2"><span>5:18: (</span><span class="c1">Jesus confirms the authority of Scripture</span><span class="c4">) Throughout the NT, Jesus uses Scripture to teach, to make defence, to resist satan, and to reason with the Jews, sometimes basing His argument on a single word (Mt 22:32: &ldquo;God of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob&rdquo;; &ldquo;is&rdquo;, not &ldquo;was&rdquo;). Over and over again, Jesus confirmed the accuracy and the authenticity of the OT. By quoting the Scripture, He testified to their divine origin and authority. (MacArthur)</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c4">5:18: The honest Jew knew he could not fulfill all the requirements of the Mosaic law; not even the traditions of the elders. Many hoped the Messiah would bring God&rsquo;s standard down to a level they could manage. But Jesus made it clear that He had not come to diminish the law in the least bit, but to uphold and fulfill it in every detail. (MacArthur)</span></p><p class="c2"><span>5:18: </span><span class="c0">An iota</span><span>&nbsp;is the smallest letter of the Greek alphabet: </span><span class="c0">&iota;</span><span>. It originated from the semitic Yodh, which was a mere apostrophe, a stroke of a pen: </span><span class="c0">&#1497;</span><span>. It was the </span><span class="c3">Yodh</span><span>&nbsp;that Jesus&rsquo; Jewish hearers would have heard about. </span><span class="c0">A stroke</span><span>&nbsp;literally means &ldquo;little horn&rdquo;: small marks that help distinguish one letter from another. <br>The meaning is that not even the tiniest, seemingly most insignificant part of God&rsquo;s Word will be removed or modified </span><span class="c0">until all is accomplished</span><span class="c4">. (MacArthur)</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c4">5:18: No other statement made by our Lord more clearly states His absolute contention that Scripture is verbally inerrant, totally without error in the original form in which God gave it, down to every letter and the smallest part of every letter. (MacArthur)</span></p><p class="c2"><span>5:19: The </span><span class="c0">therefore</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;refers to what Jesus has just said about the law: the law is utterly pertinent to those who trust in God, because it is His Word and is exalted by the prophets and accomplished by the Messiah Himself. (MacArthur)</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c4">5:19: By lowering the law you weaken its power in the hands of God as a convincer of sin. &ldquo;By the law is the knowledge of sin.&rdquo; It is the looking-glass which shows us our spots, and that is a most useful thing, though nothing but the gospel can wash them away. ... Lower the Law and you dim the light by which man perceives his guilt; this is a very serious loss to the sinner rather than a gain (Charles Spurgeon)</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c4">5:19: The consequences of the law depend on a person&rsquo;s response to it. Whoever responds to it positively, will receive a positive result; but whoever responds to it negatively, will receive a negative result. (MacArthur)</span></p><p class="c2"><span>5:19: To </span><span class="c0">relax</span><span>&nbsp;(Gk. luo: to annul, to break, to loosen; or even to dissolve or melt). The idea is to annul God&rsquo;s law, or to make it void, by loosing ourselves from its requirements and standards. <br>Jesus used the same word in a stronger form (</span><span class="c3">kataluo</span><span class="c4">) in v. 17: &ldquo;not to abolish the Law and the prophets&rdquo;. Same word is used in Mt 16:19 and Mt 18:18: &ldquo;whatever you loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven&rdquo;.<br>Fallen human nature resents prohibitions and demands. Even Christians are tempted to modify and weaken God&rsquo;s standards, to make them less demanding than they are. But when a Christian ceases to revere and obey God&rsquo;s Word in even the slightest degree, to that degree He is being un-Christlike. Because that is something Christ refused to do.<br>(MacArthur)</span></p><p class="c2"><span>5:19: </span><span class="c0">least of these commandments</span><span>. Jesus gives indications of the relative importance of God&rsquo;s commands. There are two great commandments, one is &ldquo;great and foremost&rdquo;, and &ldquo;the second is like it&rdquo; (Mt 22:37-39). Also, in His series of woes, Jesus speaks about &ldquo;the weightier provisions of the law: justice and mercy and faithfulness&rdquo;, which should be &ldquo;done </span><span class="c3">without neglecting the others</span><span>&rdquo; (Mt 23:23). <br>Some things are more spiritually important than others. But Jesus&rsquo; point here is that it&rsquo;s not permissible to </span><span class="c0">annul</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;even one of the least ones. Some commands are greater than others, but none are to be disregarded. (MacArthur)</span></p><p class="c2"><span>5:19: </span><span class="c0">Teaching others to</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;disregard or disobey any part of God&rsquo;s word is an even worse offence. James cautions, &ldquo;teachers &hellip; will incur a stricter judgment&rdquo; (Jas 3:1). Every believer is accountable for himself, but those who teach are also accountable for those whom they teach. <br>We teach not only by our words, but also by our example. When we ignore the law&rsquo;s demands, we give loud testimony to its unimportance to us. ~Living out is teaching out. A believer&rsquo;s view of Scripture is revealed in his life and teaching.<br>(MacArthur)</span></p><p class="c2"><span>5:19: To </span><span class="c0">be called least in the kingdom of heaven</span><span>. The &ldquo;</span><span class="c0">called</span><span class="c4">&rdquo; refers not to what men say about us, but to what God says about us, because only God knows what we do and why always, and He always cares. It is God&rsquo;s prerogative to determine ranks in the kingdom, and Jesus declares that He will hold those in lowest esteem who hold His Word in lowest esteem. There is no impunity (exemption from punishment) for those who disobey, discredit, or belittle God&rsquo;s law. (MacArthur) </span></p><p class="c2"><span>5:19: Note that offenders do not lose their salvation, but are </span><span class="c0">called least</span><span>, yet still remain </span><span class="c0">in the kingdom of heaven</span><span class="c4">. But blessing, reward, fruitfulness, joy, and usefulness, will all be sacrificed to the extent that we are disobedient. What we may lose is &ldquo;a full reward&rdquo; (2 Jn 8: &ldquo;Watch yourselves, so that you may not lose what we have worked for, but may win a full reward&rdquo;). It is possible to lose in the second phase of our Christian lives what we built up in the first. (MacArthur) </span></p><p class="c2"><span>5:19: </span><span class="c0">Whoever keeps them and teaches them</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;is a person who upholds every part of God&rsquo;s law, both in their living and in their teaching. (MacArthur)</span></p><p class="c2"><span>5:19: God&#39;s moral law is the reflection of God&#39;s very character, and is therefore changeless and eternal. The things it requires will not have to be commanded </span><span class="c0">in heaven</span><span class="c4">, but they will be manifested in heaven because they manifest God. While on earth, we do not naturally reflect the character of God, but His moral standards continue to be commanded and supernaturally produced. (MacArthur)</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c4">5:20: Man-made religion or self-righteousness will never get one even close to the kingdom of Heaven. (John Strohman)</span></p><p class="c2"><span>5:20: (</span><span class="c1">self-righteousness is insufficient</span><span>) It is the false teaching of salvation by self-effort that Jesus confronts head-on in this verse, and which all of Scripture, from beginning to end, contradicts. <br>The parable of the </span><span class="c0">Pharisee</span><span>&nbsp;and a tax-collector was told &ldquo;to some who </span><span class="c3">trusted in themselves</span><span>&nbsp;that they were righteous, and treated others with contempt&rdquo; (Lk 18:9), where the Pharisee prayed self-righteously. (see note on </span><span class="c1 c6"><a class="c8" href="#id.dwbcdy95tjug">Lk 18:9</a></span><span>). <br>The Jews had a saying, &ldquo;If only two people go to heaven, one will be a scribe, and the other a pharisee&rdquo;. Those men were completely convinced that God was obligated to honor their devoted and demanding works. In comparing themselves with others, they could not imagine God was not favorably impressed with their goodness.<br>Jesus teaches that that the sort of </span><span class="c0">righteousness</span><span>&nbsp;exemplified by the Pharisees was not sufficient to gain entrance into His </span><span class="c0">kingdom</span><span class="c4">. To Jesus&rsquo; legalistic, works-oriented hearers, this was doubtlessly the most radical thing He had yet taught. If the meticulously religious and moral Pharisee could not get into heaven, who could?<br>(MacArthur)</span></p><p class="c2"><span>5:20: (</span><span class="c1">more is required</span><span class="c4">) After showing the preeminence (v. 17), permanence (v. 18), and pertinence (v. 19) of Scripture, Jesus now shows its purpose. In context, Jesus says that whatever they did with man-made tradition, they did not live up to the standards of Scripture.<br>The implied truth of the verse is this: the purpose of God&rsquo;s law was to show that, to please God and to be worthy of citizenship in His kingdom, more righteousness is required that anyone can possibly have or accomplish in himself. The purpose of the law was not to show what to do in order to make oneself acceptable, but to show how utterly sinful and helpless all men are in themselves.<br>The initial step toward kingdom citizenship is poverty of spirit: recognizing one&rsquo;s total wretchedness and inadequacy before God.<br>(MacArthur)</span></p><p class="c2"><span>5:20: (</span><span class="c1">the righteousness God requires</span><span>) </span><span class="c0">Surpasses</span><span>&nbsp;is used of a river overflowing its banks, emphasizing that which is far in excess of the normal. The Lord requires genuine </span><span class="c0">righteousness</span><span class="c4">, real holiness that far exceeds anything human (&ldquo;human banks&rdquo;) and that exists only in the redeemed heart, for &ldquo;the Lord looks at the heart&rdquo; (1 Sam 16:7)<br>When the inside is beautiful, outward beauty is appropriate; but without inner beauty, outward adornment is pretense and sham.<br>God not only requires inner righteousness, but perfect righteousness. &ldquo;You therefore must be perfect, as your heavenly Father is perfect.&rdquo; (Mt 5:48). To be qualified for God&rsquo;s kingdom, we must be as holy as the King Himself. That standard is so infinitely high that even the most self-righteousness person would not dare to claim to possess it or be able to attain it.<br>(MacArthur)</span></p><p class="c2"><span>5:20: (</span><span class="c1">the righteousness God gives</span><span>) How such a holy heart can be obtained? &ldquo;Who then can be saved?&rdquo;. Jesus answered: &ldquo;With men this is impossible, but with God all things are possible&rdquo; (Mt 19:25-26)<br>God gives what He demands. The One who tells us of the way into the kingdom is Himself that way (Jn 14:6: &ldquo;I am the way, and the truth, and the life. No one comes to the Father except through me&rdquo;).<br>The King not only sets the standard, but will Himself bring anyone up to that standard who is willing on the King&rsquo;s terms. This is why &ldquo;a person is not justified by works of the law but through faith in Jesus Christ&rdquo; (Gal 2:16). To be justified is to be made righteous, and to be made righteous by Christ is the only way to become righteous.<br>God gave the impossible standard, and then Himself provided the fulfillment.<br>(MacArthur)</span></p><p class="c2"><span>5:20: (</span><span class="c1">what self-righteousness is</span><span>) Their </span><span class="c0">righteousness</span><span>&nbsp;was: external, partial, redefined, and self-centered.<br></span><span class="c1">External</span><span>. The scribes and the Pharisees concerned themselves with external observance of the law and tradition, taking little consideration of motives and attitudes. They saw nothing wrong with having evil thoughts as long as they did not carry out those thoughts externally (hate, but not kill; lust, but not have). <br>Jesus condemned this sort of hypocritical righteousness in Mt 23 with series of woes. Jesus&rsquo; next teachings in the Sermon on the Mount shows that God&rsquo;s first concern is with the heart: with such things as anger, hatred, and lust. Hypocrisy cannot substitute for holiness. <br>Same applies to religious ceremony: unless our giving, prayer, and fasting are done out of humble, loving spirit, they count for nothing (6:5-18). Ritual cannot substitute for righteousness.<br></span><span class="c1">Partial</span><span>. The righteousness they practiced was partial, woefully incomplete. They tithed, but showed total disregard for weightier matters such as justice, marcy, and faithfulness, because those things are essentially the reflections of a transformed heart. It is impossible to be merciful, just, and faithful, without a divinely wrought change. No external formality can produce that.<br></span><span class="c1">Redefined</span><span>. Like many liberal theologians of today, the scribes and the Pharisees took biblical terms and redefined them to suit their own human perspectives and philosophy, and reworked biblical standards in keeping with their own desires and capabilities.<br>Even such commands as &ldquo;Consecrate yourselves therefore, and be holy; for I am holy&rdquo; (Lev 11:44) they interpreter not as a call to pure heart, but as a requirements of certain rituals. Knowing they can&rsquo;t be holy, they simply changed the meaning of holiness.<br></span><span class="c1">Self-Centered</span><span>. Their righteousness was produced by self, and for the purposes of self-glory. Above all else, they sought to be self-satisfied, and their system of religion was designed to enhance that self-satisfaction by providing ways to accomplish external, showy things about which they could boast and be proud. Their satisfaction came when they received approval and commendation from men.<br>In stark contrast, the godly person is broken about his sin, mourns about the wicked condition of his inner life, and has absolutely no confidence in what he is and can do. He longs for the righteousness only God can give out of His mercy and grace.<br>But the person who is righteousness in his own eyes sees no need for any other righteousness, not need for salvation, mercy, forgiveness, or grace. The Pharisees did not want the grace the Messiah now offered; they wanted to rule their own lives their own way. &ldquo;being ignorant of the righteousness of God, and seeking to establish their own, they did not submit to God&#39;s righteousness.&rdquo; (Rom 10:3).<br><br>Those who insist on coming to God in their own way and their own power will never reach Him; they </span><span class="c0">shall never enter the kingdom of heaven</span><span>. No church, no ritual, no works, no philosophy, no system can bring a person to God. Those who try to work their way into God&rsquo;s grace know nothing of wht His grace is about.<br>It is tragic that many people today, like the scribes and the Pharisees, will try any way to God but His way. They will pay any price, but will not accept the price He paid. They will do any work for Him, but they will not accept the finished work of His Son for them. Such people are religious but not regenerated, and they </span><span class="c0">shall not enter the kingdom of heaven</span><span class="c4">.<br>(MacArthur)</span></p><h4 class="c25" id="h.4r9y1bo5yi8t"><span class="c15 c0">Introduction: Correcting Pharisees</span></h4><p class="c2"><span>5:21-43: (</span><span class="c1">contrast</span><span>) In the rest of the chapter, Jesus gives 6 illustrations correcting the rabbinical, traditional teaching. Knowing that His self-righteous hearers could not possibly understand what He was saying, Jesus contrasted human teaching with the divine Word of God.<br>In vv. 17-20 Jesus just said that His teaching stands firmly in agreement with the OT teaching, while the Jewish religious tradition </span><span class="c3">did not</span><span>.</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;<br>These examples deal with specific subjects of murder, sexual sin, divirce, speaking the truth, retaliation, and loving others. Yet they all illustrate the same basic principle: righteousness is a matter of the heart.<br>(MacArthur)</span></p><p class="c2"><span>5:21-43: (</span><span class="c1">structure</span><span class="c4">) Jesus first refers to two of the Ten Commandments, then to two more general principles in the Law, and finally, to the two broad principles of mercy and love.<br>(MacArthur)</span></p><p class="c2"><span>5:21-43: Every section starts with a form of the phrase &ldquo;</span><span class="c0">the ancients told</span><span class="c4">&rdquo;, which cannot refer to God&rsquo; Word, which Jesus came to uphold. It refers to the human teaching that contradicted God&rsquo;s Word. (MacArthur)</span></p><p class="c2"><span>5:21-43: (</span><span class="c1">Jews separated from scripture</span><span class="c4">) As Martyn Lloyd-Jones has pointed out, the condition of Judaism at the time of Christ was remarkably like that of the church in the early 16-th century. The Scriptures were not translated into the languages of the people. The liturgy, the prayers, the Scripture reading, and even most of the hymns and anthems were in Latin, which none of the common people knew or understood. When a priest gave a sermon or homily, the people had nothing by which to judge what he said. They had no idea as to whether or not his message was scriptural, or even whether or not being scriptural was important. The Bible taught what the church said it taught. The church, therefore, placed its own authority over that of Scripture. <br>In a less extreme way, the Jews of Jesus&rsquo; day had been separated from their Scriptures. Even though there was a Septuagint, it was bulky and expensive, and it was not used or understood by most Jews in Palestine. When it was read, most hearers understood little, and accepted whatever the leaders said.<br>ANd most scribes and rabbis did not attempt to expound the scriptural text itself, but rather taught from the Talmud, an exhaustive collection of rabbinical traditions.<br>(MacArthur)</span></p><p class="c10 c16"><span class="c4"></span></p><h4 class="c25" id="h.xc2kl17k5y93"><span class="c15 c0">Anger</span></h4><p class="c2"><span>5:21-26: (</span><span class="c1">the flow of the Sermon on the Mount</span><span class="c4">) From the beginning of the Sermon on the Mount, Jesus focuses on the internal, on what men are like in their minds and hearts. This is the primary thrust of the rest of the chapter. Contrary to the superficial righteousness of the Pharisees, God requires internal righteousness. If it does not exist in the heart, it does not exist at all. <br>(MacArthur)</span></p><p class="c2"><span>5:21: An important biblical principle: although one may think himself good by his external deeds, </span><span class="c3">God judges the heart</span><span class="c4">. (John Strohman)</span></p><p class="c2"><span>5:21: </span><span class="c0">Those of old</span><span>&nbsp;refers to the rabbis and scribes </span><span class="c0">of old</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;who had devised the many traditions with which Judaism had become encumbered and which had virtually replaced the authority of the Scriptures. (MacArthur)</span></p><p class="c2"><span>5:21: (</span><span class="c1">Why murder is a sin</span><span>) In the OT, the penalty for </span><span class="c0">the killer</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;was death, and the reason for such severe punishment was that man was made in God&rsquo;s image. To take the life is to assault the sacredness of the image of God. (MacArthur)</span></p><p class="c2"><span>5:21: &ldquo;</span><span class="c0">You shall not murder</span><span>&rdquo; is from the decalogue, and it does not prohibit every form of killing. The term used for </span><span class="c0">murder</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;has to do with criminal killing. It&rsquo;s clear from other teachings in Scripture that capital punishment, just warfare, accidental homicide, and self-defense are excluded. The commandment is against the intentional killing for purely personal reasons, whatever those reasons might be. (MacArthur)</span></p><p class="c2"><span>5:21: (</span><span class="c1">Rabbinical definition of murder</span><span>) As in most cultures and religions, the rabbinical tradition defined </span><span class="c0">murder</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;as strictly limited to the act of physically taking another person&rsquo;s life. Jesus had already warned that God&rsquo;s righteousness &ldquo;surpasses that of the scribes and the Pharisees&rdquo; (v. 20). As the chosen custodians of God&rsquo;s Word, they should have known that God commands heart-righteousness, not just external, legalistic behavior. But the rabbinical interpretation obscured the divinely intended meaning. (MacArthur)</span></p><p class="c2"><span>5:21: (</span><span class="c1">Punishment reduced by the rabbinical teaching</span><span>) Although the commandment, </span><span class="c0">though shall not murder</span><span>, is Scriptural, the penalty (</span><span class="c0">&ldquo;shall be liable to court</span><span class="c4">&rdquo;) fell short of the biblical standard because it did not prescribe the penalty of death. The rabbis confined murder to a merely civil issue, prosecuted by a human court; and they confined its evil to the physical act. (MacArthur)</span></p><p class="c2"><span>5:22: (</span><span class="c1 c0">Anger</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;is the source</span><span>) Jesus attacks the self-confidence of people who are certain that are innocent of murder, because the first step of murder is </span><span class="c0">anger</span><span class="c4">. To one degree or another, it makes all men would-be murderers.<br>It is possible for a model, law-abiding citizen to be as guilty of murder as anyone on death row. It is possible for a person to have more of a murderous spirit that a multiple killer. Many people, in the deepest feelings of their hearts, have anger and hatred to such a degree that their true desire is for the hated person to be dead. At the same time, other feelings may be preventing them from doing that: fear, cowardice, lack of opportunity, [or even pride].<br>(MacArthur)</span></p><p class="c2"><span>5:22: </span><span class="c0">But I say to you</span><span class="c4">. Jesus contrasts His teaching not with the OT, but with the rabbinical tradition. He told people God&rsquo;s truth on the matter. (MacArthur)</span></p><p class="c2"><span>5:22: </span><span class="c0">liable to judgment</span><span>. Jesus uses the same phrase He had used in the previous verse to indicate that, since the very same punishment is applicable to </span><span class="c0">anger</span><span>, the guilt itself is also identical. Murder is prefigured by anger and is preceded by anger; therefore, anger, being the source, makes the person </span><span class="c0">guily</span><span class="c4">, even though the physical act hasn&rsquo;t been committed.<br>It is the thoughts of heart, not the acts of the hand, that is God&rsquo;s foremost concern (Ps 51:6: &ldquo;you delight in truth in gthe inward being&rdquo;; 1 Sam 16:7: &ldquo;the LORD looks on the heart&rdquo;).</span></p><p class="c2"><span>5:22: </span><span class="c0">Angry</span><span class="c4">. Jesus says that if a person is angry, hates, curses, or maligns another person, &mdash; he is guilty of murder (!) and deserves a murderer&rsquo;s punishment. <br>John teaches the same truth: &ldquo;Everyone who hates his brother is a murderer&rdquo; (1 Jn 3:15).<br>(MacArthur)</span></p><p class="c2"><span>5:22: (</span><span class="c1">the story of Two-Gun Crowley</span><span class="c4">) In the spring of 1931 one the most notorious criminals of that day was captured. Known as Two-gun Crowley, he had brutally murdered a great many people, including several policemen, to whom he had great hatred since childhood.<br>His girlfriend notified the police about his whereabouts after seeing Crowley with another woman.<br>To hunt him down, the police has gathered a force of 300 officers armed with rifles, machine guns, and tear gas, outside the an apartment building. They exchanged fire for nearly two hours, until he was finally arrested.<br>It is said that the police found a blood-spattered note on him that read, &ldquo;Under my coat is a weary heart, but a kind one; one that would do nobody any harm&rdquo;. Such an obvious self-deceit seems absurd, yet that is exactly what&rsquo;s natural to us: &ldquo;I may have done some bad things, but down deep, I&rsquo;m not really bad&rdquo;. <br>Crowley was executed one year later upon a court&rsquo;s decision.

A forbidding place where trash was continually burned and where the fire, smoke, and stench never ceased.<br>In the valley, King Ahaz had &ldquo;burned his sons in fire&rdquo; (2 Chron 28:3) and erected an altar to Molech, on which human sacrifice had sometimes been offered. It would later be called &ldquo;the valley of Slaughter&rdquo; (Jer 19:6). King Josiah tore down the altars and turned the valley into the garbage incinerator. The name of the valley therefore came to be a metonym for the place of eternal torment, and was so used by Jesus 11 times.<br>(MacArthur)</span></p><p class="c2"><span>5:23: Jesus calls us to go and </span><span class="c0">be reconciled</span><span>&nbsp;with our </span><span class="c0">brother</span><span>&nbsp;not only when they have wronged us, but even if they think that we have wronged them. Whenever </span><span class="c0">a brother has something against you</span><span>, objectively or subjectively, it is us who need to be the first to exhibit the desire for a </span><span class="c0">reconciliation</span><span class="c4">, and act accordingly.</span></p><p class="c2"><span>5:23: (</span><span class="c1">The effect on our worship of God</span><span class="c4">) As long as there is internal sin, outward acts of worship are not acceptable to God. Jesus continues to focus on the particular sin of hatred against someone else. Reconciliation must precede worship: sin causes a breach in one&rsquo;s relationship with God, and the offerings that are intended to restore a right relationship with Him are empty in such a situation. Unresolved conflict has priority and must be settled: not to do so is to be a hypocrite by asking for forgiveness from God without actually repenting. (MacArthur)</span></p><p class="c2"><span>5:23: The phrase </span><span class="c0">your brother has something against you</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;could mean that even if we are holding nothing against him, if he is angry with or hates us, we should do everything in our power to be reconciled to him. Regardless of who is responsible for the break in relationship, we should determine to make a reconciliation before we come to God to worship. (MacArthur)</span></p><p class="c2"><span>5:25: (</span><span class="c1">The effect on our relations with others</span><span class="c4">) This verse is essentially a commentary on the previous one. The time for reconciliation is always now. Tomorrow is often too late. We are not to allow bitterness or any other sin to keep us separated from other people.

Without that purity, the outward life makes no difference. God&rsquo;s divine evaluation takes place in the heart. (MacArthur)</span></p><p class="c2"><span>5:27: (</span><span class="c1">commandments</span><span>) Jesus considers two of the commandments. The sixth commandment (&ldquo;thou shall not kill&rdquo;) protects the sanctity of life, and the seventh (&ldquo;</span><span class="c0">you shall not commit adultery</span><span class="c4">&rdquo;) protects the sanctity of marriage. Those who rely on external righteousness break both of those commandments, because in their hearts they attack the sanctity of life and the sanctity of marriage, whether they do so outwardly or not: it&rsquo;s enough to hate or to lust. (MacArthur)</span></p><p class="c2"><span>5:27: (</span><span class="c1">stoning</span><span>) The Mosaic law portrays </span><span class="c0">adultery</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;as one of the most despicable and heinous of sins, punishable by death (Lv 20:10: &ldquo;both the adulterer and the adulteress shall surely be put to death&rdquo;; Dt 22:22: &ldquo;both of them shall die. So you shall purge the evil from Israel.&rdquo;). In every case, without exception, it is a heinous sin against God.

It technically refers to sexual intercourse between a man and a woman when one of them is married, but in both the OT and the NEW the word relates to sexual intercourse with anyone other than one&rsquo;s marriage partner. Although Jesus speaks specifically of adultery here, it seems clear that in a wider sense the term applies to the unmarried as well.

(MacArthur)</span></p><p class="c2"><span>5:28: (</span><span class="c1">sexual culture</span><span class="c4">) Sexual temptations have been strong since man&rsquo;s fall, but no society in history has had such an increase in the preoccupation and permissiveness of sexual culture as we have today. Like some Corinthian believers (1 Cor 6:13), people tend to think that sex is just a biological act with no moral implications, no different morally from eating or sleeping. (MacArthur)</span></p><p class="c2"><span>5:28: </span><span class="c0">I say to you</span><span class="c4">. Jesus puts His own word above the authority of revered rabbinic tradition. (MacArthur)</span></p><p class="c2"><span>5:28: </span><span class="c0">Looks</span><span class="c4">. Present participle, refers to the continuous process of looking. Not an incidental glance, but an intentional and repeated gazing. (MacArthur)</span></p><p class="c2"><span>5:28: </span><span class="c0">To lust for</span><span>. Indicates a goal or an intention. The </span><span class="c0">looking</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;is done with the purpose of lusting. Jesus is speaking of the man who looks so that he may satisfy his desire. He is speaking of the man who goes to an X-rated movie, who selects a TV program known for its sexual content, who goes to a place known for its display of naked bodies, and who does so with the expectation and desire of being sexually and sinfully titillated (aroused). (MacArthur)</span></p><p class="c2"><span>5:28: </span><span class="c0">Has already committed</span><span class="c4">. It is not lustful looking that causes the sin in the heart, but the sin in the heart causes lustful looking. The lustful looking is the expression of a heart that is already immoral and adulterous. (MacArthur)</span></p><p class="c2"><span>5:28: (</span><span class="c1">nothing new</span><span class="c4">) Jesus did not teach anything new: from the OT times it was clear that sins start in the heart. Take Job 31:1,7-8: &ldquo;I have made a covenant with my beyes; how then could I gaze at a virgin? if my step has turned aside from the way and my heart has gone after my eyes, ...&ldquo;. Job new that sin begins in the heart. He therefore determined in advance to guard himself and not to gaze at a woman who might tempt him. (MacArthur)</span></p><p class="c2"><span>5:28: (</span><span class="c1">habits</span><span class="c4">) A popular proverb goes: &ldquo;Sow a thought and reap an act. Sow an act and reap a habit. Sow a habit and reap a character. Sow a character and reap a destiny&rdquo;. Sin always begins in the mind and heart. <br>And just as adulterous heart plans to expose itself to lust-satisfying situations, the godly heart plans to avoid. Both hearts prepare in advance: one indulges itself in advance, the other protects itself in advance. (MacArthur)</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c4">5:29: Drastic measures are necessary: it is better to lose something, and be removed from temptation, rather than be exposed to it.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c4">5:29: No sin is committed at once. Long before a sin is committed, there is a heart that was either unprepared, or worse, has dwelt on the thought of coming to that point.<br>No adultery is committed all of a sudden. Long before adultery is actually committed, there was a man who let himself approach a woman he finds himself attracted to, and lets the situation develop to a point where he does not want to resist anymore. <br>And this happens because he hasn&rsquo;t prepared his mind well in advance. Because he has not learned God&rsquo;s truth, has not dwelt on righteousness, and has not made up his mind in advance.</span></p><p class="c2"><span>5:29-30: An </span><span class="c0">eye causing you to sin</span><span>&nbsp;stands for the sins of perception; the </span><span class="c0">hand causing you to sin</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;stands for the sins of action.</span></p><p class="c2"><span>5:29: </span><span class="c0">&#1042;&#1099;&#1088;&#1074;&#1072;&#1090;&#1100;</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&#1089;&#1086;&#1073;&#1083;&#1072;&#1079;&#1085;&#1103;&#1102;&#1097;&#1080;&#1081; &#1075;&#1083;&#1072;&#1079; &#1085;&#1091;&#1078;&#1085;&#1086; &#1085;&#1077; &#1088;&#1091;&#1082;&#1086;&#1081;, &#1072; &#1074;&#1086;&#1083;&#1077;&#1081;. &#1050;&#1090;&#1086; &#1085;&#1077; &#1089;&#1084;&#1086;&#1090;&#1088;&#1080;&#1090; &#1085;&#1072; &#1090;&#1086;, &#1095;&#1090;&#1086; &#1089;&#1086;&#1073;&#1083;&#1072;&#1079;&#1085;&#1103;&#1077;&#1090;, &#1090;&#1086;&#1090; &#1091;&#1078;&#1077; &#1074;&#1099;&#1088;&#1074;&#1072;&#1083; &#1091; &#1089;&#1077;&#1073;&#1103; &#1089;&#1086;&#1073;&#1083;&#1072;&#1079;&#1085;&#1103;&#1102;&#1097;&#1080;&#1081; &#1075;&#1083;&#1072;&#1079;.

It is unbiblical.(MacArthur)</span></p><p class="c2"><span>5:29: (</span><span class="c1">extremes</span><span class="c4">) Origen (AD 185-254), one of the outstanding early church fathers, was so convicted of his own sinfulness by reading this passage that he had himself castrated.<br>Saint Anthony sought to escape immorality and lived in a desert for 35 years, in poverty and deprivation. Yet by his own testimony, he was never freed in all that time from the cares and temptations, because his heart was still in the world and could not escape the world. He quickly discovered that satan, the god of this world, had no difficulty finding him in the desert.<br>Getting rid of harmful influences will not change a corrupt heart into a pure heart. Outward actions itself cannot produce inner benefits, but when done out of a pure motive, they reflect a pure heart and help it seek God&rsquo;s will.<br>(MacArthur)</span></p><p class="c2"><span>5:29: In Jewish culture, </span><span class="c0">the right eye</span><span>&nbsp;and </span><span class="c0">right hand</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;represented a person&rsquo;s best and most precious faculties: one&rsquo;s best vision, and one&rsquo;s best skills.

Obviously, Jesus is speaking figuratively of the things that make us more susceptible to temptation. We should be willing to give up whatever is necessary, even the most cherished things we possess, if doing that will help protect us from evil. Nothing is so valuable as to be worth preserving at the expense of righteousness. (MacArthur)</span></p><p class="c2"><span>5:29: </span><span class="c0">Causes to you sin/stumble</span><span>&nbsp;(Gk. </span><span class="c3">skandalizo</span><span class="c4">) basically means to cause to fall.

(MacArthur)</span></p><p class="c2"><span>5:29: </span><span class="c0">Pluck it out</span><span class="c4">. Anything that morally or spiritually traps us, that causes us to fall into sin or to stay in sin, should be eliminated quickly and totally. The message of the hyperbolic statement is that sin must be dealt with radically.

Jesus did not quote that part, because the rabbis who taught on divorce have been teaching that divorce was permissible </span><span class="c3">on any grounds</span><span>. They either did not quote that part about indecency, or interpreted it in such a was that any displeasure would count for indecency.</span></p><p class="c2"><span>5:31: (</span><span class="c1">rabbinic teaching</span><span>) </span><span class="c0">It was said</span><span>. In Jesus&rsquo; day, the dominant rabbinic position was that divorce (and remarriage) was permissible on any grounds, and </span><span class="c0">the certificate</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;was the only requirement. Divorce had become so easy and casual that a man could dismiss his wife for such trivial things as burning his meal or embarrassing him in front of his friends. Often the husband did not bother to give a reason, since none was required. (MacArthur)</span></p><p class="c2"><span>5:31: (</span><span class="c1">old testament</span><span>) The rabbinic justification for such easy </span><span class="c0">divorce</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;was based on an erroneous interpretation of Dt 24:1-4. The focus of that passage is not the question of whether or not divorce is permitted: it does not provide for divorce, much less command it. It shows how improper divorce leads to adultery, which results in defilement. A woman is defiled because of the adultery brought about by her second marriage. Moses is saying, then, that the divorce for indecency or promiscuity creates an adulterous situation. (MacArthur)</span></p><p class="c2"><span>5:31: (</span><span class="c1">old testament: indecency</span><span>) In Dt 24:1, the literal rendering of </span><span class="c0">indecency</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;is &ldquo;the nakedness of a thing&rdquo;. Some interpret it as repeated indecent exposure. It actually means every kind of improper, shameful, or indecent behavior unbecoming to a woman and embarrassing to her husband. It cannot refer to adultery, because death was the penalty for that. <br>It must have been sins of unfaithfulness and promiscuity that stopped just short of actual adultery. And the verse did not allow a divorce in such a situation; Moses is actually saying that the divorce for indecency or promiscuity creates an adulterous situation where a woman becomes defiled if she was divorced because of a mere indecency. (MacArthur)</span></p><p class="c2"><span>5:31: </span><span class="c0">The certificate</span><span>. The </span><span class="c0">certificate</span><span>&nbsp;did not make the</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;divorce</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;right, but only gave the woman some protection: it protected her reputation from slander and provided proof of her legal freedom from her former husband and her consequent right to remarry. (MacArthur)</span></p><p class="c2"><span>5:31: (</span><span class="c1">divorce permissible</span><span>) Through Moses, God recognized and permitted </span><span class="c0">divorce</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;as an accommodation of His grace for human sin (Mt 19:3: &ldquo;Is it lawful to divorce one&#39;s wife for any cause?&rdquo;; Mt 19:8: &ldquo;Because of your hardness of heart Moses allowed you to divorce your wives, but from the beginning it was not so&rdquo;). God never commanded divorce but only permitted it as a concession to sinful, self-willed mankind. (MacArthur)</span></p><p class="c2"><span>5:32: </span><span class="c0">Adultery</span><span class="c4">. Jesus affirms what Moses taught in Dt 24:1-4: that unjustified divorce inevitably leads to adultery. By allowing a no-fault divorce, the keepers of the law have caused a bight of adultery to contaminate God&rsquo;s people. (MacArthur)</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c4">5:32: Jesus confronted them with a proper interpretation of God&rsquo;s law. He said that every time a man without proper cause turned his wife loose to remarry, he forced her into adultery, which made him guilty also. In addition, the man who married the former wife and the woman who married the former husband were likewise guilty of adultery. Jesus&rsquo; whole point is that divorce leads to adultery. (MacArthur)</span></p><p class="c2"><span>5:32: </span><span class="c0">Except on the ground of sexual immorality.</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;This condition is not a way out that God provides, but is the only grounds for divorce that He will recognize. Marriage was never meant to be separated (Mt 19:6: &ldquo;what therefore God has joined together, let no man separate&rdquo;); adultery, another reality that God never intended, is the only thing that can break the bond of marriage. <br>That&rsquo;s not a change of the OT law.

Mutual mistrust (&ldquo;credibility gap&rdquo;) is one of the major marks of the world system where the prince is satan, &ldquo;the father of lies&rdquo; (Jn 8:44). We shade the truth, we cheat, we exaggerate, we misrepresent income tax deductions, we make promises we have no intention of keeping, we make up excuses, and betray confidences, &mdash; all as a matter of normal, everyday living. So much of business, politics, government, science, religion, and even family life is built of falsehoods and half-truths. Individually, men are inclined to the truth only when it benefits them. (MacArthur)</span></p><p class="c2"><span>5:33: (</span><span class="c0">oaths</span><span>&nbsp;by God) In the OT there are several occasions on which God has made an </span><span class="c0">oath</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; obviously, not because His word would otherwise be questionable or unreliable, but because He wished to impress upon men a special importance related to the promise. (MacArthur)</span></p><p class="c2"><span>5:33: (</span><span class="c0">oaths</span><span>&nbsp;by men) </span><span class="c0">An oath</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;invoking the name of someone greater than the person making the oath is supposed to give greater credibility to what it said. Any oath calling God invites Him to witness the truthfulness and to avenge if it is a lie. It is a man&rsquo;s device to communicate their truthfulness in the single specific case.<br>Obviously, an oath, no matter how strong the words used, is only as reliable as the one who makes it (for example: Mt 26:72: &ldquo;peter denied it with an oath&rdquo;). <br>(MacArthur) </span></p><p class="c2"><span>5:34-35: </span><span class="c0">By heaven, by the earth, by Jerusalem</span><span class="c4">. By OT law, oaths were to be made only in God&rsquo;s name (Dt 6:13: &ldquo;God you shall fear. Him you shall serve and by his name you shall swear.&rdquo;), even Gentiles. Knowing that, people routinely swore by heaven, by earth, by the Temple, by the hairs on their heads, and by any other thing they thought would impress those they wanted to take advantage of. By those who practiced it, it was considered to be perfectly acceptable as long as it was not in the name of the Lord. Rabbinical tradition conveniently interpreted Num 30:2 that violating any other oath was permissible to accommodate the sinful, selfish purposes of the people who wanted to lie. (MacArthur) </span></p><p class="c2"><span>5:34-35: In Mt 23:21-22 (swearing by heaven, swearing by the Temple) Jesus&rsquo;s point is that to carelessly and dishonestly call any part of His creation as witness to a false oath was to dishonor God Himself, whether or not His name was invoked. </span><span class="c0">Heaven</span><span>, </span><span class="c0">earth</span><span>, </span><span class="c0">Jesuralem</span><span>, and every person&rsquo;s </span><span class="c0">head</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;is God&rsquo;s, and it is therefore wicked and sinful to use any part of His creation as witness to anything that is deceitful or dishonest. Prov 12:22: &ldquo;lying lips are an abomination to the Lord&rdquo;. (MacArthur)</span></p><p class="c2"><span>5:34: </span><span class="c0">Do not take an oath at all</span><span>. In light of OT passages approving oaths, and Him not coming to abolish the law, it can hardly be correct, as many interpret this passage, that Jesus here forbids the making of any oath under any circumstance. In accordance with the OT, we are to swear by no other name but God&rsquo;s. The greatest error in the system was in its basic deceptiveness, and this is what Jesus is speaking against.</span></p><p class="c2"><span>5:37: </span><span class="c0">Yes, yes. No, no</span><span>. Christian character has to be of such an integrity that every word is true even without an oath, and every </span><span class="c0">yes</span><span>&nbsp;can be trusted to be a true </span><span class="c0">yes</span><span>, and every </span><span class="c0">no</span><span>&nbsp;really means </span><span class="c0">no</span><span class="c4">. Jesus commends simple truthfulness in thought, word and deed.</span></p><h4 class="c25" id="h.4n6p9a7r6ibp"><span class="c15 c0">Retaliation</span></h4><p class="c2"><span>5:xx: (</span><span class="c1">the flow of the Sermon on the Mount</span><span class="c4">) Jesus continues to correct the rabbinical tradition which has come to a point where it allowed personal retaliation. Which is against both the OT and the NT.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c4">5:38: This OT concept (Dt 19:21) was not about personal revenge but the execution of justice by the authorities. The phrase means that the punishment of the guilty must be in proportion to the crime (John Strohman)</span></p><p class="c2"><span>5:38: </span><span class="c0">An eye for an eye, and a tooth for a tooth</span><span>. An OT principle of </span><span class="c3">lex talionis</span><span>: that punishment should exactly match the crime. Same idea is carried in the expression </span><span class="c3">quid pro quo</span><span class="c4">. The purpose was to 1) curtail further crime (Dt 19:20: &ldquo;the rest will hear and be afraid&rdquo;); and to 2) prevent excessive punishment: a selfish overreaction, the type of which Lamech boasted (Gen 4:23-24: &ldquo;i killed a man for wounding me&rdquo;). That&rsquo;s because human vengeance is never satisfied with justice; it wants a pound of flesh for an ounce of offence. (MacArthur)</span></p><p class="c2"><span>5:38: </span><span class="c0">Eye for an eye</span><span class="c4">. The principle has been often wrongly viewed throughout history as a mandate for vengeance. (MacArthur)</span></p><p class="c2"><span>5:38: (</span><span class="c1">no retaliation allowed; but care of your enemies</span><span>) </span><span class="c0">Eye for an eye</span><span class="c4">. In all three accounts, the principle has to do with the civil justice system. God does not allow humans to avenge themselves, but restricts vengeance to Himself: &ldquo;vengeance is Mine, and retribution&rdquo; (Dt 32:35). God&rsquo;s command for the individual has always been, &ldquo;If your enemy is hungry, give him bread to eat, and if he is thirsty, give him water to drink&rdquo; (Prov 25:21). No individual has the right to &ldquo;do to him as he has done to me&rdquo; (Prov 24:29: &ldquo;do not say&rdquo; this). (MacArthur)</span></p><p class="c2"><span>5:39: </span><span class="c0">Do not resist</span><span>. We are not to retaliate (</span><span class="c0">eye for an eye</span><span class="c4">), but to forgive. It is our personal responsibility; it is the requirement of the government to execute justice (Rom 13:1-7). Never take revenge (Rom 12:19-21). Jesus &quot;did not revile&quot;, &quot;uttered no threats&quot; (1 Pet 2:23). This personal non-retaliatory concept is not to be confused with standing by while evil is directed against others. (John Strohman)</span></p><p class="c2"><span>5:39: </span><span class="c0">Do not resist</span><span class="c4">. The only person who is non-defensive and never bears a grudge is the person who has died to self. To fight for one&rsquo;s rights is to prove that self is still on the throne of the heart. (MacArthur)</span></p><p class="c2"><span>5:39: </span><span class="c0">Do not resist him who is evil</span><span>. Jesus does </span><span class="c0">not</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;teach, as many have claimed, that no stand is to be taken against evil, and that it should simply be allowed to take its course. Jesus and the apostles continually opposed evil with every means and resource (the cleansing of the temple; &ldquo;resist the devil&rdquo; in Jas 4:7; exorcism done by Paul in Acts 16:16; &ldquo;why did you strike Me?&rdquo; by Jesus in Jn 18:23; &ldquo;you yourself violate the law by commanding that I be struck&rdquo; said by Paul in Acts 23:3; &nbsp;...more examples?). Jesus, however, never resisted any evil directed at Himself. He prayed, &ldquo;forgive them, for they do not know what they are doing&rdquo; (Lk 23:34).<br>(MacArthur)</span></p><p class="c2"><span>5:39: </span><span class="c0">Do not resist him who is evil.</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;From many passages in the NT it is clear that this principle does not apply to governmental authorities, for they &ldquo;do not bear the sword for nothing&rdquo; (Rom 13:4). Judges and magistrates are God&rsquo;s instruments for preserving law and order by being a terror to evil. (MacArthur)</span></p><p class="c2"><span>5:39-42: </span><span class="c0">Do not resist.</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;After establishing the basic principle of non-retaliation, Jesus picks out four basic human rights that He uses to illustrate this principle: dignity (a slap on the cheek), security (take your tunic), liberty (go that extra mile), and property (give to the one who asks). (MacArthur)</span></p><p class="c2"><span>5:39: A </span><span class="c0">slap</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;is not an act of violence, but an insignificant insult, or a violation of one&#39;s rights (AMP). It was a great insult in Jewish culture (John Strohman)</span></p><p class="c2"><span>5:39: </span><span class="c0">A slap</span><span>. Among Jews, a </span><span class="c0">slap</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;or other striking in the face was an attack on one&rsquo;s honor and was considered a terrible indignity. Even a slave would rather receive whipping than be slapped in the face. (MacArthur)</span></p><p class="c2"><span>5:39: </span><span class="c0">Turn to him the other also</span><span>. Jesus&rsquo; point is in what we are </span><span class="c3">not</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;to do. Turning the other cheek symbolizes the non-avenging, non-retaliatory, humble and gentle spirit that is to characterize kingdom citizens. We are not to defend out dignity by retaliation.

(MacArthur)</span></p><p class="c2"><span>5:40: </span><span class="c0">His tunic</span><span>. A </span><span class="c0">tunic</span><span>&nbsp;was worn as an undergarment, and the </span><span class="c0">cloak</span><span>&nbsp;was an outer garment that also served as a blanket at night. Most people owned only one coat and probably one or two tunics. It was the </span><span class="c0">cloak</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;that Mosaic law required be returned to its owner &ldquo;before the sun sets, for that is his only covering; it is his cloak for his body&rdquo; (Ex 22:26-27). (MacArthur)</span></p><p class="c2"><span>5:40: </span><span class="c0">Let him have your cloak</span><span class="c4">. The extremely valuable outer garment, which could not be demanded by the court of law, should be surrendered voluntarily, rather than causing offense with an adversary. We should be willing to offer even more in order to show our regret for any wrong we did, and to show that we are not bitter or resentful. In doing so, we will show the love of Christ. (MacArthur) &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c2"><span>5:41: </span><span class="c0">Forces you</span><span class="c4">. Kingdom citizens are to be willing to sacrifice their liberty. Like all other rights, freedom is not to be cherished and protected at the expense of righteousness. (MacArthur)</span></p><p class="c2"><span>5:41: </span><span class="c0">Forces you to go one mile</span><span>. Roman law gave a soldier the right to </span><span class="c0">force</span><span>&nbsp;a civilian to carry his pack for a </span><span class="c3">milion</span><span>, a Roman </span><span class="c0">mile</span><span class="c4">, which was slightly shorter than our modern mile. Being the oppressors, Roman soldiers were never more hated than when they forced someone to carry their pack. (MacArthur)</span></p><p class="c2"><span>5:41: </span><span class="c0">Go with him two miles</span><span class="c4">. Even with so despised a burden, we should carry it willingly. And we should surrender even more of our liberty rather than retaliate. In doing so, we are obedient to our Lord and testify to His righteousness. (MacArthur)</span></p><p class="c2"><span>5:42: </span><span class="c0">The one who begs</span><span class="c4">. The implication is that the person has a genuine need.

They want to have the satisfaction of viewing themselves as very altruistic people. Others think that by doing something good they can offset some bad thing they have done.

They had a little silver trumpet and he used to go in the streets and the synagogues, not the temple, because this was not the &ndash; the temple giving. But this was the &ndash; the giving to the needy at the synagogue and the &ndash; and the streets, as it indicates there, just in the course of life. And they would blow a little silver trumpet. And it was kind of like all you poor, come one come all, your great benefactor has arrived. And all the poor would come at the blowing of the little trumpet and the guy would start doling out the money.<br>We have our own little trumpets. We want to let people know we gave. We go home to our wife and then say, &ldquo;Boy, what I&rsquo;ve done for him, you&rsquo;d think that he could treat me a little different.&rdquo; And we &ndash; we want to find somebody that we can tell. It&rsquo;s just that we want our little trumpet. We don&rsquo;t want a big trumpet, just a little trumpet. And then we get appeals from Christian organizations, if you will give us money we&rsquo;ll send you a certificate for your wall. Now that is a trombone, folks. And then if you want a tuba, you can get a plaque. You can just &ndash; you can have a whole band in your office blowing all over the place. You can be a member of the inside group. See?<br>(MacArthur)</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c4">6:2: And if I read the Bible properly, I&rsquo;m going to take any reward that I would ever get &ndash; and so will you &ndash; and cast it at His feet in adoration and praise. And I should seek to have a reward if for no other reason that I might show Him my love in giving Him all that I have. But there are rewards. Would you notice the promise of reward in verse 1? It says, &ldquo;If you do your righteousness before men to be seen, you have no reward of your Father who&rsquo;s in heaven.&rdquo; All right? Verse 2, &ldquo;If you blow your trumpet and do your thing so that everybody can see, verily I say unto you they have their reward.&rdquo; Now, in verse 1, it says you have no reward and in verse 2 it says they have their reward. Now do you do or do you don&rsquo;t?<br>The point is simple. You have a reward in verse 2, but it is not from your Father who is in heaven. Who&rsquo;s it from? Well, who did you want it from? Who were you doing your thing for? For men, right? You get your reward. They saw it, that&rsquo;s it. That&rsquo;s it. The key is your Father who&rsquo;s in heaven. You get an earthly reward, not a heavenly one. You get something from men and nothing from God. You forfeit that. If you&rsquo;re an actor on a stage, if you&rsquo;re hupokrit&#275;s, if you&#39;re just doing your thing for the applause of men, what you get is the applause of men. That&rsquo;s it.<br>(MacArthur)</span></p><p class="c2"><span>6:3: There is a very big difference between your good works glorifying you as compared to your good works getting others to glorify God. Mt 5:16 teaches that our good works should </span><span class="c3">glorify God</span><span>, not us. &nbsp;If you are told that something you did was very kind, you should tell that person you did it because you are Christian. This will inform him that your motivation is from Christ and not of your own goodness. The end result will be that Christ is glorified and not yourself. At that moment you should also look for an opportunity to witness to him about salvation in Christ. (John</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;Strohman)</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c4">6:3: Did you know that in the Apocrypha, for example in Tobit chapter 12, verse 8, it says &ldquo;It is good to do alms rather than treasure up gold for alms deliver from the death and this will purge away every sin&rdquo;? The Jews actually taught that they would purge away their sins by giving money to the needy. That&rsquo;s how far they&rsquo;ve gone. In Sirach 3:30 it says, &ldquo;Alms will atone for sin.&rdquo; I found several quotes out of the Talmud. &ldquo;Alms giving is more excellent than all offerings and is equal to the whole law.&rdquo; &ldquo;Alms giving will deliver from the condemnation of hell and make one perfectly righteous.&rdquo;<br>Now, that&rsquo;s going a little far, isn&rsquo;t it? They believed you could get perfectly righteous by giving your money. You see that&rsquo;s why the Jews believed that the richer you were, the easier it was to get in the kingdom, because you bought your way in. And so, when Jesus said it&rsquo;s harder &ndash; it&rsquo;s easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than a rich man to get into heaven, it devastated their whole conception, see? Because they thought the rich could buy their way in easy because purging of sin came from giving away money.<br>By the way, the Roman Catholic Church picked this up. Leo the Great said this, &ldquo;By prayer we seek to appease God. By fasting we extinguish the lust of the flesh and by alms we redeem our sins.&rdquo; By the way, the Pope who just visited America believes that. That&rsquo;s part of the system. They made it a saving element. And then they made it an element for piosity. Boy, they really put it on as a big display. And Jesus goes right by all of that stuff on the outside and says the only thing God cares about is your heart, not what you did, but why you did it. See? Two people doing the same thing, giving money to a poor man. Why did they do it makes the difference.<br>(MacArthur)</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c4">6:3: But there is a reward for those who give out of a right heart. Verse 3 tells about it. &ldquo;But when thou doest alms,&rdquo; &ndash; mercy giving &ndash; &ldquo;let not thy left hand know what thy right hand doeth.&rdquo; That&rsquo;s a funny statement, isn&rsquo;t it? People have wondered about that. It&rsquo;s a funny statement. Some believe it was a Proverb of the time for doing things so spontaneously that you didn&rsquo;t really think about them and I agree with that. It&rsquo;s as if you&rsquo;re walking along &ndash; and the right hand was usually the active hand, most people being right-handed.<br>You&rsquo;re walking along the street and here&rsquo;s somebody with a need. And without a long process of calculation, without a lot of thought and analysis and checking out your bank book or whatever. Here&rsquo;s a need and you just reach in and you slip it over there. And your left hand which is down here by your left hip doesn&rsquo;t even know what&rsquo;s happening. That&rsquo;s the idea.<br>Hebrews used to speak in very graphic and physical terms. And the left over here on this side wouldn&rsquo;t even know what the right hand is doing. I mean it&rsquo;s not as if you&rsquo;re stopping and saying now let me think about this. Let me calculate how much and you just &ndash; boom! It&rsquo;s spontaneous, it&rsquo;s free, it&rsquo;s uninhibited. It&rsquo;s based on the compassion and the mercy of the moment. The left hand isn&rsquo;t even aware of it. And that&rsquo;s the essence of what he&rsquo;s saying. The normally active right hand passes a &ndash; a needy person, stretches out so lively, so quickly. So easily does the right hand meet the need and your left hand never even knows what&rsquo;s going on.<br>And you know what&rsquo;s kind of nice about it too? If the left hand doesn&rsquo;t know, the left hand can&rsquo;t get involved. And it&rsquo;s very hard to clap with one hand. Have you ever tried to do that? It&rsquo;s very difficult. The left hand isn&rsquo;t going to say a thing. The idea is the freedom and the spontaneity without calculating it. Just give it. You say, &ldquo;But what am I going to do to make sure? The Lord will bless. I&rsquo;ll tell you. I&mdash;I personally &ndash; I don&rsquo;t &ndash; this is not a biblical &ndash; personally giving to the church is a great blessing, and systematically and weekly we do that. But the greatest blessing to me is that right hand thing that the left hand never knows about. That to me is the biggest joy, to just give and not even think about how much or can you, you know, can you afford it. You just respond to the need.<br>(MacArthur)</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c4">6:3: Besser said that the temple had a special place where the bashful benefactors, he called them, could come. They wanted to give to the poor, but they were bashful. And so, they would just come and they would just put money there. And then there were the bashful poor, who didn&rsquo;t want to ask, and the bashful poor would come in in another place and they would take what they needed. And the name of the place was Silence. Silence. I love that. Nothing to be said, just needs to be met. (MacArthur)</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c4">6:5: These verses continue the theme Jesus set out in previous sections. The point is that our relationship with God is not built on external actions but our heart attitude while doing external actions (or private actions for that matter). (John Strohman)</span></p><p class="c2"><span>6:5: The primary concern of the Pharisees was for others to see them engaging in religious acts. Their view of prayer was that it could be used as a vehicle to have others think well of them. </span><span class="c0">They have their reward in full</span><span class="c4">: They have achieved their goal, but their prayers were of no spiritual benefit, and will not be heard nor answered, since they did not pray in faith (John Strohman)</span></p><p class="c2"><span>6:9-13: Jesus gave us an outline. 9. In reverent praise. 10. For the coming </span><span class="c0">kingdom</span><span>. 11. For </span><span class="c0">daily</span><span>&nbsp;provision. 12.

For </span><span class="c0">forgive</span><span class="c4">ness of our sins, for the forgiveness of others. (John Strohman) </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c4">6:9: &quot;Prayer will make a man cease from sin, or sin will entice a man to cease from prayer&quot; (John Bunyan)</span></p><p class="c2"><span>6:16: The Pharisees saw </span><span class="c0">fasting</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;as an opportunity to get the approval of others who saw them. This is the same attitude they had about prayer. It was all external appearances. False humility is actually pride, and worthless in the sight of God (John Strohman)</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c4">6:19: Our view should be that material things and daily provisions are not to be looked upon with either greed or fear of lack. They are both under the sovereign hand of God, who will provide for us. (John Strohman)</span></p><p class="c2"><span>6:19: </span><span class="c0">Treasures</span><span class="c4">: luxuries, material items over and above the necessities needed for life. Luxuries are not evil, but it is our attitude towards them that can be evil. (John Strohman)</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c4">6:20: You see, you have to begin with this. God doesn&rsquo;t need your money. All right? Doesn&rsquo;t need it. Gets along fine without it. In fact, do you realize that God got along throughout all eternity before He ever made you without your money? That&rsquo;s right.<br>Now the thing you must realize is that you need to give it. That&rsquo;s all. Paul essentially that to the Philippians when He said, I thank you for your offering. I didn&rsquo;t need it, but you needed to give it because when you gave it you put yourself within the framework of God&rsquo;s blessing. You see, giving is all about getting. Giving is all about being blessed. God says release it that I may multiply it to your account. <br>It&rsquo;s the blessing that is the issue. There&rsquo;s a cycle of blessedness and maybe I could illustrate it with a couple of Scriptures.<br>First &ndash; and there are many &ndash; but first would be Proverbs 11, verse 25. &ldquo;The liberal soul shall be made fat. And he that watereth shall be watered also himself.&rdquo; Now there&rsquo;s a principle. The more you give the more you get. You water, you get watered. The next verse, he applies it to withholding grain. If a farmer withholds the grain and never sows the grain in the ground or never sells the grain to get the money to buy the seed to plant again, he&rsquo;ll starve to death. There is a cycle, right? You grow the grain. You sell the grain. You get money. With the money, you buy seed. You plant the seed. You grow the grain. You sell the grain. You get the money. You buy the seed. You plant, and then around and around and around. And the whole thing depends upon your faithfulness to sow the seed.<br>As you scatter resources, do you realize a farmer takes everything he has and throws it in the dirt and operates on faith that God will give him a return. God gives him a return and that&rsquo;s the cycle. That&rsquo;s the illustration. &ldquo;The liberal soul shall be made fat.&rdquo; Then backing up to verse 24 is the point. &ldquo;There is he that scatters and increases and he that withholds more than is fitting and it leads to poverty.&rdquo; In other words, as you give God blesses. And when God blesses you out of your giving, out of His blessing you give again. You see? I give. God blesses. Out of the blessing, I give again. And the cycle of blessing goes like that.<br>Now. if you step out of that circle or cycle of blessing and don&rsquo;t give; you don&rsquo;t give, there&rsquo;s nothing for which God to bless. There&rsquo;s no return and it just keeps tending to poverty. Pretty soon you&rsquo;re out of resources. The principle in all giving is not &ndash; and I&rsquo;m not just talking about monetary things, but the whole of spiritual blessedness. The principle of giving is this. You need to give because it puts you in a circle of blessing. And what you give God blesses. And when He returns the blessing, out of the blessing He returns, you give again.<br>In Deuteronomy chapter 16, verse 10, we read &ldquo;And thou shalt keep the feast of weeks with the Lord thy God with a tribute of a freewill offering of thine hand, which thou shalt give unto the Lord thy God, according as the Lord thy God hath blessed thee.&rdquo; Now here you&rsquo;re picking up the cycle. The Lord thy God has blessed thee so out of His blessing you give. And as you give, He in turn will bless. Verse 17, &ldquo;Every man shall give as he is able according to the blessing of the Lord thy God which He hath given thee. And so, there is the cycle. You give. God blesses; out of His blessing you give again.<br>Number one, giving is investing with God. All right? Giving is investing with God and that&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;ve been saying. It puts you in the cycle of blessing. <br>Luke 6:38 tells us, &ldquo;Give and it shall be given unto you; good measure, pressed down and shaken together and running over.&rdquo; When God gives you can shake His box and it&rsquo;s still running over. You don&rsquo;t ever get cheated when you give to God &lsquo;cause He returns the blessing multiplied. And with whatever measure you measure it shall be measured to you again. So whatever you invest with God that&rsquo;s what you get a return on. Giving is investing with God.<br>Second Corinthians 9:6 says &ldquo;If you sow sparingly, you reap sparingly. If you sow bountifully, you reap bountifully.&rdquo; God does not need your money. But you need to invest with Him to get into the flow of His blessedness. You want a rich life? That&rsquo;s the way to do it. We could &ndash; there are many who do this and you can just give testimony after testimony. Sometimes, you know, you feel kind of guilty, because God pours out such blessing. But it&rsquo;s out of that that you again invest with Him.<br>Secondly, giving is investing with God and secondly giving is to be sacrificial. If there isn&rsquo;t a sacrifice involved it&rsquo;s questioned whether you&rsquo;re even giving at all unless there&rsquo;s some sacrifice. David said, &ldquo;I will not give God that which costs me nothing.&rdquo; I will not give God that which costs me nothing. That would say nothing to Him. You don&rsquo;t say, &ldquo;God here. I don&rsquo;t need this.&rdquo; That isn&rsquo;t any great act of love. It&rsquo;s when you give God that which you do feel you need that you&rsquo;ve made a sacrifice.<br>There&rsquo;s a third principle. Giving is not related to how much you have. People say, &ldquo;If I had more, I&rsquo;d give more. I&rsquo;m waiting till my ship comes in, then the Lord will hear from me.&rdquo; Your ship won&rsquo;t make any difference. In fact, you&rsquo;ll probably get on your ship and sail away and indulge yourself like you&rsquo;ve always done. You know, Luke 16:10 says &ldquo;He that is faithful in little will be faithful in much. And He that is unjust in little will be unjust in much.&rdquo; It isn&rsquo;t going to change your character to have more. You know, you must learn when you have a little.<br>Giving is not a matter of how much have, it&rsquo;s a matter of where your heart is and what your commitment is. <br>Fourthly, it correlates with spiritual riches. In other words, if you&rsquo;re not faithful in what you do with money, God&rsquo;s not about to give you the true riches, it says in Luke 16:11-12. If you&rsquo;re not faithful over money, the unrighteousness mammon, then who is going to give you the true riches. What are true riches? Souls, people, ministry. And God is not about to give a strategic ministry to somebody who can&rsquo;t handle money. There are many men who never made it through seminary because they couldn&rsquo;t handle money and the Lord didn&rsquo;t want them in His ministry.<br>Fifth, giving is to be personally determined, personally determined. &ldquo;As every man purposes in his heart,&rdquo; &ndash; 2 Corinthians 9 says &ndash; &ldquo;so let him give.&rdquo; verse 7. Whatever you purpose in your heart to give, that&rsquo;s between you and God. The Macedonians gave abundantly out of their deep poverty. The Philippians gave because they chose to give out of their heart of love. It is to be a spontaneous act of the heart. There&rsquo;s not any prescription. It&rsquo;s personally determined.<br>Sixth, we are to give in response to need. We are to be sensitive and listen to needs. In Acts 4 and Acts 5, the early church shared its resources because there were people who had a need. Paul went all through Asia Minor collecting money from the Gentile churches to give to the saints of Jerusalem because there was a need.<br>Seventh, giving demonstrates love not law. You&rsquo;re not under any law to give. There&rsquo;s no New Testament law to give in a sense of an amount of a fixed sum. We&rsquo;re not giving to please some legal system. It is an act of love that we give. That&rsquo;s why it&rsquo;s to be cheerful, not grudging and not of necessity. It&rsquo;s not a law. It&rsquo;s an act of love. Now listen. Those are simple principles. Invest with God, make it sacrificial. Remember it&rsquo;s not a matter of how much you have. Another principle: God will give you the real riches when He sees how you handle money. It is to be personally determined. It is to be in response to need. It is demonstrate love, not law.<br>And I might sum it up with number eight by saying all of these things tell us that our giving is to be generous, generous, generous. And the generosity with which you give will be determined by all of these other factors. How much do you want to invest with God? How much are you willing to sacrifice for Him who sacrificed all for you? How much of the spiritual riches do you really want to be worthy of? How much of the need do you want to meet? How much love are you trying to demonstrate. So the point is this, people, and I&rsquo;m hitting it from other ways. God is not saying give because I need your money. He&rsquo;s saying give because it&rsquo;s a spiritual exercise that brings into your life the true blessing of God.<br>(MacArthur)</span></p><p class="c2"><span>6:21: Col 3:5-6 defines greed as idolatry. 1 Tim 6:9-10 say that it is the </span><span class="c3">love</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;of money that is the root of all sorts of evil.

An &quot;evil eye,&quot; conversely, was a stingy, jealous or greedy eye; yet it also signifies here a bad eye. In Greek, Jesus uses the word &quot;single&quot;, in the sense of it being &quot;perfect&quot;, which acts as a transition to his next point, for the &quot;single&quot; eye is literally undivided: thus one is not divided between two masters, as the text goes on to explain (v. 24). Therefore, the meaning of the verse is: if we value material possessions, it will blind us to the truth of our disobedience and affect our whole relationship with God.

We are to &quot;judge those within the church&quot; (1 Cor 5:12-13), and to correct a sinning brother (Mt 18:15-17; Lv 19:17).The Christian is never to judge another with the objective of exalting himself, but with a heart of love that desires the repentance of the wayward person. Finally, the correcting believer will fully examine his own frailty, which will result in compassion for the person he approaches (See Gal 6:1-3).

The passage is a continuation of the Sermon on the Mount, which is constantly demonstrating the distinction between false/hypocritical religion and a true love for God. &nbsp;Pharisees (who were among the hearers) had set up a religion of their own by changing God&#39;s Word.

But there is a tremendous difference: the foundation, that&#39;s invisible. Once the edifice is up, you can&#39;t see the foundation anymore. And so it really becomes difficult to tell.

Quite naturally, they were hated by their own people: not only as extortioners, but as traitors: ranked with the lowest of human society &mdash; </span><span class="c0">sinners</span><span>, prostitutes and Gentiles. </span><span class="c0">Matthew,</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;also called Levi, was a tax gatherer. It is doubtful that he was very religious, because tax-gatherers were ostracized from many synagogues, and sometimes even from the Temple.

(MacArthur)</span></p><p class="c2"><span>9:9: </span><span class="c0">Tax collector</span><span class="c4">. There were two kinds. &nbsp;There were Gabbai. &nbsp;They were the general tax collectors; they collected property tax, income tax, poll tax, standardized. &nbsp;There was not apparently as much graft at that level. &nbsp;Then, there were the Mokhes. &nbsp;They collected the duties. &nbsp;They collected duty on everything. &nbsp;They set up their little deal where the roads crossed and they collected on all import, all export, all items bought, all items sold. &nbsp;They set tolls on roads, tolls on bridges, tolls on harbors. &nbsp;They set tolls on axles, how many legs on your donkey, packages, letters, you name it, everything. &nbsp;Everything.<br>That was Matthew. &nbsp;He was a Mokhes, taxed everything. &nbsp;There were two kinds of Mokhes. &nbsp;There was one who was called a Great Mokhes. &nbsp;He was a guy who hired some hireling to do the tax collecting, and he faded into the background. &nbsp;He didn&rsquo;t really want to be associated with the actual activity itself. &nbsp;And he retained a little more dignity because he backed off. &nbsp;That was called a Great Mokhes. &nbsp;Then, there was the Little Mokhes, the small Mokhes. &nbsp;He was too cheap to hire somebody to collect the taxes, he was so greedy he did it himself, and didn&rsquo;t care about the social stigma. &nbsp;And Matthew was that, a Little Mokhes. &nbsp;He was, verse 9, &ldquo;Sitting at the tax office himself.&rdquo; &nbsp;Greedy extortioner, traitor to his people.<br>(MacArthur)</span></p><p class="c2"><span>9:9: (</span><span class="c1 c0">Matthew</span><span class="c1">, the disciple of Christ</span><span class="c4">) Let&rsquo;s take Matthew first, because we have already examined something of Matthew&rsquo;s life in looking at chapter 9. &nbsp;Matthew is mentioned in every list, always in the same group, but nothing is ever said about Matthew, and nothing is ever said by Matthew except one tiny little thing. &nbsp;And look in Matthew 9:9, and that&rsquo;s where you find it. &nbsp;Mark and Luke both allude to the same thing in just the same few words, and that is the extent of everything we know about Matthew. &nbsp;&ldquo;And as Jesus passed forth from there He saw a man named Matthew sitting at the tax office, and He saith unto him, &lsquo;Follow Me.&rsquo; And he arose and followed Him.&rdquo; &nbsp;And when Matthew puts his name in the list in chapter 10 verse 3 he says: &ldquo;Matthew the tax collector.&rdquo; &nbsp;And may I hasten to add that no other disciple in the list is ever associated with his job. &nbsp;Why does Matthew say, Matthew the tax collector? &nbsp;I mean, that&rsquo;s not something you&rsquo;re proud of. &nbsp;No. &nbsp;A tax collector was the most hated, despised, despicable human being in the society of Israel. &nbsp;And Matthew is showing us his genuine humility, and sense of sinful unworthiness.<br>Why does Matthew even comment about himself in verse 9? &nbsp;&ldquo;As Jesus passed forth from there He saw a man named Matthew and He said, &lsquo;Follow Me.&rsquo;&ldquo; What is the point of putting that there? &nbsp;The point is: in verses 1 to 8, Matthew is giving a demonstration that Jesus came to forgive sin. &nbsp;Verse 5: &ldquo;Thy sins be forgiven thee.&rdquo; &nbsp;Verse 6: &ldquo;The Son of Man hath power on earth to forgive sins.&rdquo; &nbsp;And Matthew slips himself in there in one verse to show that indeed Jesus can forgive sin, for he sees himself as the vilest sinner. &nbsp;It may be a reason, that may be a reason why Matthew never speaks. &nbsp;He never asks a question. &nbsp;He never makes a comment. &nbsp;He never appears in an incident. &nbsp;He just is absolutely faceless and voiceless through the entire narrative of the gospels. &nbsp;And it may be that his humility was born out of his overwhelming sense of sinfulness, that he was so overwrought by the sin of his life, that once forgiven, grace was so superabundant in his case that he felt himself unworthy to even speak a word. &nbsp;And so, he is the silent man, until the Spirit of God asks him to pick up his pen. &nbsp;And then, he is given the privilege of writing the opening of the New Testament: 28 chapters on the majesty of the King of Kings Himself.<br>Matthew was a traitor. &nbsp;Matthew was an extortioner. &nbsp;Matthew was a robber and a thief. &nbsp;Matthew was greedy. &nbsp;Matthew was a social pariah, or outcast. &nbsp;And he knew it. &nbsp;You see, to be a tax collector is to be a publican. &nbsp;And what that meant was, that you as a Jew were used by the Roman government to collect taxes from the Jews to give to Rome. &nbsp;You then sort of worked for the oppressor. &nbsp;You were a traitor, first class. &nbsp;And not only that, but you bought the right to collect taxes, so you paid the government. &nbsp;You bought into the system. &nbsp;And then, the government would stipulate a certain amount of tax that had to be collected, and that was given to Rome. &nbsp;And then, you were free to collect anything more you could from the people, and that you kept for yourself. &nbsp;And so, there were bribes, and extortionist&rsquo;s routes taken, abuses beyond what we could even dream. &nbsp;They hated a tax collector so much that the Talmud said, &ldquo;It is righteous to lie and deceive a tax collector.&rdquo; &nbsp;That is the Talmud says that, not the Bible, so keep that in mind. &nbsp;No tax collector was ever permitted to testify in a court of law because everyone knew they were liars, and took bribes. &nbsp;No tax collector or publican could ever enter a synagogue or a temple to worship God because they were cut off from God. &nbsp;And that&rsquo;s why in Luke 18 when you have the publican, it says, &ldquo;And the publican standing a far off, beat on his breast and said, Lord, be merciful to me,&rdquo; a what? &nbsp;&ldquo;A sinner.&rdquo; &nbsp;He couldn&rsquo;t even go in the place. &nbsp;They were the worst, turned their back on their people, bought into an evil oppressive system. &nbsp;A pagan, uncircumcised system where the people worshipped a false god, the emperor, traitors.<br>I think what makes it so fascinating to me also: he also had a name Levi, which indicates that he really was in the flow of Jewish tradition. &nbsp;And what also is interesting is that in the gospel of Matthew, you might be interested to note, there are more quotes of the Old Testament than in Mark, Luke and John combined. &nbsp;So, Matthew knew the Old Testament. &nbsp;In fact, he quotes out of the three sections of the Old Testament that a Jew knew: the law, the prophets, and the Hagiographa, the Holy Writings. &nbsp;Matthew knew the law of God in the Old Testament. &nbsp;And yet, we have no idea of him at all being interested in spiritual things. &nbsp;But when Jesus comes along, verse 9, He says to him, &ldquo;Follow Me,&rdquo; and he arose and followed Him. &nbsp;Instantly.<br>(MacArthur)</span></p><p class="c2"><span>9:14: Devout Jews &nbsp;used to fast twice a week (Lk 18:12: &quot;I fast twice a week&quot;). To them, that was emblematic of holiness. And so they ask Jesus: why don&#39;t Your disciples fast??! What Jesus told them was that there is a time for fasting, and there is a time for joy. Fasting is a unique experience that is identified with grief and sorrow and pain, isolation, loneliness, fear, those kinds of times that </span><span class="c3">would not exist when you are walking in the presence of Jesus Christ</span><span class="c4">! Fasting, in the teaching of Jesus, is for the times of great concern, great anxiety, great sorrow, and great prayer. There are times when it wouldn&#39;t be appropriate to fast because you&#39;re enjoying the fullness of the presence of God and His blessing. Fasting reserved for the times of prayer: when we&#39;re so engulfed that we have no desire to eat. // Some people think that if you just arbitrarily don&#39;t eat, there&#39;s some spiritual virtue in it. But the real issue is in the prayer area. &nbsp;(MacArthur)</span></p><h3 class="c7" id="h.y373tz5wlzfw"><span class="c11 c0">Chapter 10</span></h3><p class="c2"><span>10:1: (</span><span class="c1">unqualified disciples</span><span>) </span><span class="c0">Twelve</span><span class="c4">.

Just 11 faithful men, not particularly gifted either. All of them basically unqualified for the task. And yet, these men literally turned the world upside down. It is amazing what God can do with just a very few people. <br>Watch this verse: &ldquo;For there is no restraint to the Lord to save by many or by,&rdquo; what? &ldquo;few.&rdquo; (1 Sam 14:6) &nbsp;Did you get that? &nbsp;It doesn&rsquo;t matter to God whether you have a lot or a little. &nbsp;That is never the issue with Him. &nbsp;He can put all of His divine power through one person as easily as He could put it through a multitude. &nbsp;It doesn&rsquo;t matter to the Lord. <br>And here Jesus has 12 men who literally turned the world upside down. Listen, what kind of people does God use? &nbsp;He uses the common kind like we are. He uses the unqualified.<br>I&rsquo;m going to close with this illustration. &nbsp;There was a concert violinist who wanted to demonstrate a very important point he felt, so he hired a great hall in a city and announced that he would play a concert on a $20,000.00 violin. &nbsp;He had the place packed with violin lovers, came out, and he played exquisitely, and they applauded just gloriously. &nbsp;He bowed and took their applause, threw the violin to the ground, and stomped it into bits. &nbsp;The people were horrified. &nbsp;And then, he walked off the stage. &nbsp;The stage manager came out and said, &ldquo;Ladies and Gentlemen, to put you at ease, that was a $20.00. &nbsp;He will now return to play the $20,000.00,&rdquo; or whatever it was, &ldquo;violin.&rdquo; &nbsp;And you know what? &nbsp;They couldn&rsquo;t tell the difference, and he made his point. &nbsp;It isn&rsquo;t the instrument; it&rsquo;s the artist, right?<br>Now folks, let&rsquo;s face it, most of us are $20.0 .00 violins, at best, right? &nbsp;At best. &nbsp;But oh, what music can the Master make with us.<br>(MacArthur)</span></p><p class="c2"><span>10:2-4: (</span><span class="c1">kinds of disciples</span><span>) What have we learned about them in terms of the kind of people the Lord uses? &nbsp;Well, He uses strong, dynamic, bold leaders like Peter who take charge, initiate, strategize, confront. &nbsp;He uses humble, gentle, inconspicuous souls like Andrew, quietly seek no prominence but bring people to Christ behind the scenes. &nbsp;He uses zealous, passionate, ambitious, uncompromising, task-oriented, insensitive men like James who wind up being early martyrs. &nbsp;He uses loving, sensitive people-oriented, believing, trusting, intimate, truth-seekers like John. &nbsp;He uses skeptical, analytical, mechanical slow to believe, slow-witted, visionless, pessimistic, unsure men like Philip. &nbsp;And He&rsquo;ll use even a man with prejudice in his heart, who is a seeker of truth, and honest, and open, and clear-minded, and deeply surrendered like Nathanael. &nbsp;And He&rsquo;ll use an outcast, extortionist, tax collector, a traitor, and the most hated man in his entire society like Matthew, who knows he is a sinner and seeks forgiveness, and He&rsquo;ll turn him into a meek and quiet humble man who loves the riffraff of society, and who has a great faith in Christ.

Pointing to the huge crowds that followed John and that were now following Him, Jesus likens them to an invading army surrounding a city to capture it. &ldquo;</span><span class="c0">From the days of John the Baptist until now</span><span>,&rdquo; there has been an extraordinary rush of people pressing in from all sides, eager for a blessing. The &ldquo;</span><span class="c0">kingdom of heaven suffers violence</span><span>,&rdquo; figuratively speaking, in that people were so thronging to hear the gospel that they resembled an army trying to besiege a city. And the &ldquo;</span><span class="c0">violent take it by force</span><span>&rdquo;; the people entering the kingdom were not violent literally, but their eagerness to see the coming of the Messiah was so overwhelming that it was as if they were attacking a city and beating down the doors to enter. (</span><span class="c1 c6"><a class="c8" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.gotquestions.org/kingdom-God-suffers-violence.html&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1582399365448000">gotquestions.org</a></span><span class="c4">)</span></p><p class="c2"><span>11:12: The word translated &ldquo;</span><span class="c0">the violent</span><span>&rdquo; always carries a negative connotation. It therefore cannot describe a positive action, as in &ldquo;eager men are forcing their way into it&rdquo; (J.B. Phillips). It must refer to those who opposed the kingdom. This becomes even more obvious when we recognize that the word translated &ldquo;</span><span class="c0">take</span><span>&rdquo; (or &ldquo;lay hold of&rdquo;) almost always involves malicious intent. Therefore the wicked people that fit this description are Herod Antipas, who imprisoned John the Baptist (v. 2), and the Jewish leaders who opposed Jesus&rsquo; ministry, and the kingdom to be under attack by the forces of darkness, represented by those </span><span class="c0">violent people</span><span class="c4">.

The violation of Sabbath was in </span><span class="c3">rubbing </span><span class="c4">them with their hands: see parallel in Lk 6:1.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c4">12:3: What is the parallel between these two episodes? Human need takes priority over ceremonial regulations, and care about people, is above religious traditions.</span></p><p class="c2"><span>12:14: Notice that </span><span class="c0">Abram</span><span>&nbsp;agrees with his </span><span class="c0">wife Sarah</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;even before entering Egypt, so he was fearing a situation he did not yet encounter. It is possible that he did not foresee how bad the lie will turn out in the end: initially he thought that it was a good idea, and it all seemed to work out just fine &mdash; right until that moment when Pharaoh has decided to take Sarah as his wife. Abram probably did not have the courage to tell the truth because he&rsquo;s already said otherwise.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c4">12:14: See note on another account of Gen 20:2, where Abimelech takes Sarah as his wife.</span></p><p class="c2"><span>12:31: </span><span class="c0">Blasphemy against the Spirit</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;is the point of no return: when the Holy Spirit had been prompting a person to stop sinning, but the person, by ignoring the spirit, has brought himself to such a condition that he is so deaf to the Spirit that he can no longer repent. For as long as you are worried about sin, you hear the Spirit&#39;s guidance, and you can repent. But if one keeps sinning, there is a point of no return, after which repentance is no longer possible: not because God won&#39;t forgive, but because the person wouldn&#39;t seek God&#39;s forgiveness. When, like the Pharisees here, the person would even deny the things that are obvious.</span></p><h3 class="c7" id="h.jer5x5cq3x9x"><span class="c11 c0">Chapter 13</span></h3><p class="c2"><span>13:20-21: So it is possible to </span><span class="c0">receive</span><span>&nbsp;the word, even to have </span><span class="c0">joy</span><span>&nbsp;about it, and show all the signs of being on the right path &hellip; and yet prove to be the one who </span><span class="c0">falls away</span><span class="c4">.</span></p><p class="c2"><span>13:23: The seed is the same in every case, so the emphasis is on the different kinds of </span><span class="c0">soil</span><span>, which represents a human heart which can be receptive to the </span><span class="c0">word</span><span class="c4">.</span></p><p class="c2"><span>13:46: Notice that the </span><span class="c0">merchant</span><span>&nbsp;had to sell </span><span class="c0">all</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;that he had, and was willing to do so. This represents letting go of the things we used to value in order to get something that is far better.</span></p><p class="c2"><span>13:47-48: This is how the modern day church works: like a </span><span class="c0">net</span><span>, it gathers </span><span class="c0">fish of every kind</span><span>: both believers and unbelievers; but when it is </span><span class="c0">full</span><span>, when the endtime comes, it will be </span><span class="c0">sorted</span><span class="c4">. Apostle Paul expresses the same idea in 1 Cor 11:19: even within the church there are factions, and it &ldquo;has to be&rdquo; so, for when people divide, those who are genuine tend to stick together, and are thus clearly seen.</span></p><h3 class="c7" id="h.hlxrtj1ee3ib"><span class="c11 c0">Chapter 14</span></h3><p class="c2"><span>14:6: Now when somebody comes along and says, Well, how come you Christians say you&rsquo;re the only ones that have the truth?&rdquo; You tell them that&rsquo;s what Jesus said. Jesus, without question, is the most narrow-minded human who ever lived. He said, &ldquo;Everything I say to you is true and anything else is false.&rdquo; Only He back up the fact that He had a right to say it. Amen?<br>You see, this is what he&rsquo;s saying here. You don&rsquo;t make it, people, you don&rsquo;t make it. You come miserably, woefully short of the standard for my kingdom. I&rsquo;m a king. Matthew is saying that all the way through and I&rsquo;m offering a kingdom, but you&rsquo;re not going to get in it on the terms that you are now offering. There&rsquo;s another way. And that is to realize that you can&rsquo;t make it. Your theology is inadequate. Your religion is inadequate and your approach to life is inadequate. You need somebody to wash away your sin, purify you, give you a new nature fit for my kingdom. And I&rsquo;m that somebody is what Christ is saying.<br>(MacArthur)</span></p><p class="c2"><span>14:23: When someone is going </span><span class="c0">up on the mountain to pray</span><span class="c4">, walking uphill is part of this experience. It takes times to get up there, and you have time to prepare mentally, to think what are you going to pray about. It must be an experience that makes your head very clear: while the legs are moving, circulation improves. As a result, when you&rsquo;ve reached your destination, you&rsquo;re not only alone on the hill, but you are also prepared to pray &mdash; unlike those spontaneous prayers that we do from day to day when we have time and have just quit doing our business.</span></p><p class="c2"><span>14:30: </span><span class="c0">Began to sink</span><span class="c4">. People always say, &ldquo;oh, Peter, you have no faith, you sunk&rdquo;. You think Peter had no faith because he sunk; but look, there&rsquo;s 11 guys who never even got out of the boat!<br>So, before you get on Peter&rsquo;s case, realize where he was. People say, well, Peter denied the Lord. &nbsp;Right, but he was in the place where he was confronted with that because he had enough courage to follow all the way to the house of the high priest. The other guys had split. I mean, he was always in the middle of the action. &nbsp;He was always where it was going on. &nbsp;And when the resurrection came, who was the first one there? Peter and John. (MacArthur)</span></p><h3 class="c7" id="h.q2rrsm3r271m"><span class="c11 c0">Chapter 15</span></h3><p class="c2"><span class="c4">15:19: &nbsp;sin pervades us, all of our inmost being. &nbsp;Sinfulness is at the very core of the human soul. &nbsp;Jesus said, for example in Matthew 15:19 and 20, &ldquo;Out of the heart come evil thoughts, murders, adulteries, fornications, thefts, false witness, slanders. &nbsp;These are the things which defile the man.&rdquo; &nbsp;And then he said, &ldquo;The evil man out of the evil treasure of his heart brings forth what is evil, for his mouth speaks from that which fills his heart,&rdquo; Luke 6:45. &nbsp;In other words, down deep in the human heart is pervasive sinfulness, and it rises to create the kind of words and the kind of actions that we label as sinful. &nbsp;Frankly, it is human nature to love sin and hate God. &nbsp;The carnal mind, Romans 8:7 says, is enmity against God. &nbsp;We are born loving sin, loving ourselves, hating righteousness, and hating God. &nbsp;Yet, though we are born that way, mark this, sin is not a weakness or a flaw for which we cannot be held responsible. &nbsp;It is an energetic, purposeful antagonism toward God that rises out of our will. &nbsp;Sinners freely, willfully and gladly choose sin. &nbsp;In other words, the sin that is in us manifests itself in a deliberate, willful rebellion against God. (MacArhtur)</span></p><p class="c2"><span>15:19: eventually, those things on the inside will show up on the outside. &nbsp;No one ever falls into adultery. &nbsp;We read about that with pastors and others. &nbsp;No one ever falls into adultery. &nbsp;The adulterer&rsquo;s heart has been shaped by a long process of sinful thoughts and lustful thoughts. &nbsp;It gets shaped that way. &nbsp;The heart of the thief, it is bent long before his act of thievery by covetousness. &nbsp;All sin is first incubated in the mind. &nbsp;And James says in James 1:13, &ldquo;Let no one say when he is tempted. &nbsp;I&rsquo;m being tempted by God for God cannot be tempted by evil and He doesn&rsquo;t tempt anyone, but each one is tempted when he is carried away and enticed by his own lust. &nbsp;When lust is conceived it gives birth to sin, and when sin is accomplished it brings forth death.&rdquo; &nbsp;Don&rsquo;t be deceived, brethren, it all starts inside. (MacArthur)</span></p><h3 class="c7" id="h.2xw6b8d1dl6r"><span class="c11 c0">Chapter 16</span></h3><p class="c2"><span>16:6: The </span><span class="c0">Pharisees</span><span>&nbsp;expected their reward in heaven, while the </span><span class="c0">Sadducees</span><span>&nbsp;expected theirs in this life, but the trust of both groups was in personal works and self-effort. Both emphasized the superficial and nonessential, and had no concern for the genuine inner spiritual life of for the welfare of their fellow man. That was &quot;the leaven of the Pharisees and Sadducees,&quot; the hypocritical, self-serving, dead externalism about which Jesus warned His disciples (Mt 16:6). (MacArthur)</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c4">16:16: Those words are not human words (v. 17: &quot;flesh and blood has not revealed this to you&quot;); that is a divine revelation. </span></p><p class="c2"><span>16:18: </span><span class="c0">Peter</span><span>, Gk. </span><span class="c3">Petras</span><span>, does not mean </span><span class="c3">rock bed</span><span>&nbsp;like in Mt 7:24 (man who built his house on a rock, Gk. </span><span class="c3">petra</span><span>); it means a boulder, a pebble. Jesus says that &quot;you, Peter, are a pebble&quot;. A masculine word. The </span><span class="c0">rock</span><span>&nbsp;that comes later is </span><span class="c3">petra</span><span>, which means rock bed, and is a feminine noun. &quot;But upon this rock bed foundation, </span><span class="c3">petras</span><span>, I will build my church&quot;. And what was the </span><span class="c3">petra</span><span>? This rock bed foundation is the word of God. &quot;Upon that affirmation of truth I will build my church&quot;. <br>I am convinced that this </span><span class="c3">petra</span><span>&nbsp;is the word of God, and the </span><span class="c3">petra</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;of Mt 7:24 is also the word of God. (MacArthur)</span></p><p class="c2"><span>16:18: &ldquo;</span><span class="c0">I say unto you, you&rsquo;re Peter, you are a stone, but upon this bedrock,</span><span>&rdquo; He used a different term there, &ldquo;</span><span class="c0">Upon the rock of your confession, I will build My church and the gates of Hades shall not prevail against it</span><span class="c4">.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span>16:19: </span><span class="c0">you</span><span>&nbsp;is singular; in a parallel passage in Mt 18:18, </span><span class="c0">you</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;is plural.</span></p><p class="c2"><span>16:19: </span><span class="c0">loose</span><span>&nbsp;is the same word (Gk. </span><span class="c3">luo</span><span class="c4">) Jesus had used in Mt 5:19: &ldquo;whoever relaxes one of the least of these commandments and teaches others to do the same will be called least in the kingdom of heaven&rdquo;.</span></p><p class="c2"><span>16:19: What are </span><span class="c0">the keys of the kingdom of heaven</span><span class="c4">? You, My friend, are going to unlock the Kingdom. &nbsp;Really? &nbsp;Who preached the first great apostolic sermon? &nbsp;Peter, the day of Pentecost. &nbsp;To whom did he preach it? &nbsp;To the Jews. &nbsp;Who led the first Gentile to Christ? &nbsp;Peter. &nbsp;Who was it? &nbsp;Acts 10, Cornelius. &nbsp;He unlocked the Jews. &nbsp;He unlocked, as it were, the Kingdom to the Gentiles. &nbsp;He was the opening of the door. &nbsp;And the Lord also gave that same promise, by the way, to the rest of His apostles and extended it all through the ages to all those who, by the proclamation of the gospel, opened the door to the Kingdom. &nbsp;Every time I preach the gospel, I hold that key in my hand. (MacArthur)</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c4">16:24: Somewhere along your pilgrimage as a Christian you need to learn to die for yourself regularly. It saves you from being defensive, revengeful, retaliatory, hostile, accumulating the list of of things against you. (MacArthur)</span></p><p class="c2"><span>16:20-23: </span><span class="c0">Get behind me, satan</span><span>. Boy, Peter&rsquo;s feeling his oats now. Man, he&rsquo;s gotten revelations. When he opens his mouth he might be speaking or God might be speaking. And that&rsquo;s pretty exciting. Not only that, the Lord says, you&rsquo;ve got the key, you&rsquo;re going to unlock it. And he is feeling like a leader. &nbsp;<br>But in this verse, &ldquo;</span><span class="c0">Peter took Him</span><span>.&rdquo; Now, wait a minute, took </span><span class="c3">Him</span><span>? That&rsquo;s right. &ldquo;And began to rebuke Him.&rdquo; Took who? The Lord, the creator of the universe. He said to Jesus, &ldquo;Come with me, we&rsquo;ve got to get You straightened out.&rdquo;<br>Unbelievable, the guy was, I mean, he was feeling it, and I&rsquo;m the leader. &nbsp;I&rsquo;ve got the keys now I&rsquo;m going to start using them. You&rsquo;re first. It&rsquo;s always the danger in leadership, isn&rsquo;t it? It doesn&rsquo;t know where its limits are. <br>&ldquo;</span><span class="c0">And the Lord said to him, &lsquo;Get thee behind Me, Satan.&rsquo;</span><span>&ldquo; Wow, that is a very clear lesson. You do not know the plan of God, and you are thinking from the human viewpoint. &ldquo;</span><span class="c0">Get behind Me, Satan&rdquo;</span><span class="c4">. &nbsp;His mouth had just been used for God, and now his mouth was used for Satan. And now, he was doing exactly what Satan had done in the temptation: he was trying to derail Christ from the cross, and Peter was just as available to the Devil as he was to God, and that is a great lesson to learn for a leader. <br>You get yourself into a position where God can use you, and the greater the potential to be used by God, the greater the potential to be used by Satan. That&rsquo;s a great lesson. <br>(MacArthur)</span></p><h3 class="c7" id="h.lv2hsfhth85w"><span class="c11 c0">Chapter 17</span></h3><p class="c2"><span>17:12: The difficulty here is that John explicitly says that he is not </span><span class="c0">Elijah </span><span>in Jn 1:21.

Consequently, it could be argued that the parallel behaviour results from this lack of fear of God by the antagonists in the other two similar situations.<br>Christian interpretation of the incidents has varied considerably. Some commentators have seen them as regrettable exceptions in the lives of those who otherwise lived upright lives, in the same sense perhaps as Noah&#39;s and Lot&#39;s drunkenness and David&#39;s adultery. On the other hand, commentators such as Allan Turner, in his essay &quot;Lying: Is It Ever Right?&quot;, takes the standpoint that the patriarchal individuals did not actually lie, but merely concealed part of the truth.<br>(Wikipedia)</span></p><h3 class="c7" id="h.mc8gf2e7rosx"><span>Chapter 21</span></h3><p class="c2"><span>21:9: &ldquo;</span><span class="c0">Hosanna!</span><span>&quot; was something the Jews would have shouted during this feast anyway, since this is a line from the Hallel (Ps 118:25).

At the same time, in Jn 2:3-5, she seems to believe that Jesus has undeniable power, even though He has performed no miracles.

It is an </span><span class="c0">eternal</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;sin because one has to have the hardest heart possible in order to speak like that.

Even Herod&#39;s wife was not there (v. 24: &quot;went out&quot;). Herod&#39;s </span><span class="c0">daughter</span><span class="c4">&#39;s appearance was another indication of the fallen morals of that party.

Probably, Peter, James, John and Andrew had the best arguments, for they were pillars, the inner circle.</span></p><p class="c2"><span>9:35: He taught them the essence of true greatness: If anyone wants (Mk 8:34) </span><span class="c0">to be first</span><span>, to have the highest position among the &ldquo;great&rdquo; in God&#39;s kingdom, he must be the very </span><span class="c0">last</span><span>&nbsp;(lit., &ldquo;he shall be last of all,&rdquo; by deliberate, voluntary choice) and the </span><span class="c0">servant</span><span>&nbsp;of all. Here &ldquo;</span><span class="c0">servant</span><span class="c4">&rdquo; (diakonos) depicts one who attends to the needs of others freely, not one in a servile position (as a doulos, a slave). Jesus did not condemn the desire to improve one&#39;s position in life but He did teach that greatness in His kingdom was not determined by status but by service.</span></p><p class="c2"><span>9:35: </span><span class="c0">Servant</span><span>&nbsp;(Gk. </span><span class="c3">diakonos</span><span class="c4">): not someone who does everything people ask of him, but one who cares about people, who sees the need and acts on it, no walks past it.</span></p><p class="c2"><span>9:36: Ancient people did not care about </span><span class="c0">children</span><span>&nbsp;like we do: they were lowly, and at times marginalized in ancient societies. </span><span class="c0">Jesus</span><span>&nbsp;is showing them they should willingly take on lowly, often unnoticed tasks and care for those who have little status in the world. Anyone who does this, Jesus says, </span><span class="c0">receives Me</span><span>&nbsp;and in so doing also </span><span class="c0">receives </span><span>the Father (</span><span class="c0">Him who sent Me</span><span>).<br>Humbly caring for people of lowly status out of obedience to Christ (&ldquo;</span><span class="c0">in my name</span><span class="c4">&rdquo;) will be rewarded by rich personal fellowship with both the Son and the Father.<br>(ESV)</span></p><p class="c2"><span>15:11: Who crucified Christ? The </span><span class="c0">priests</span><span class="c4">. Those thought to be believers in God, more than that &mdash; the servants of God, crucified Him when He came. &ldquo;Believers&rdquo; have killed their God.</span></p><h2 class="c14" id="h.lx4o7jigv2li"><span class="c5 c0">Luke</span></h2><p class="c2"><span>1:28: The literal translation of &quot;</span><span class="c0">favored one</span><span class="c4">&quot; is &quot;one endued with grace&quot;. The Bible knows nothing of Mary&#39;s own grace except that which she received from the Lord. She was never a source of grace. (MacArthur)</span></p><p class="c2"><span>1:38: From </span><span class="c0">Mary</span><span class="c4">&#39;s reply we see that she was a godly woman who was sensitive and submissive to the Lord&#39;s will. Mary&#39;s humble reverence, thankfullness, and love for God is seen in her magnificent Magnificat in vv. 46-55. (MacArthur)</span></p><p class="c2"><span>1:46,48: </span><span class="c0">Mary</span><span>&nbsp;was just as much a sinner as all other human beings ever born. She was likely much better, morally and spiritually, than most people of her time, she was deeply devout and faithful to the Lord, but she was not sinless. Mary needed a Savior, as she herself acknowledged: &quot;</span><span class="c0">my Savior</span><span>&quot; and &quot;</span><span class="c0">humble estate of His servant</span><span class="c4">&quot;. The notions of her being co-redemptrix and co-mediator with Christ are wholly unscriptural and were never a part of early church doctrine. Those heretical ideas came into the church several centuries later, through accommodations to pagan myths. By the fourth century A.D. much of the polytheistic paganism of Rome had found its way into the church. It was from that source that the ideas of Lent, of Mary&#39;s immaculate conception, and of her being the &quot;queen of heaven&quot; originated: Semiramis (aka Ashtoreth, Isis, Aphrodite, Venus, Ishtar) was miraculously conceived by a sunbeam, and her son, Tammuz (Baal, Osiris, Eros, Cupid) was killed and raised from the dead after 40 days of fasting by his mother (the origin of Lent, the origins of the mother-child cult). Paganism had been infecting Israel before: see Jer 44:17-19: &quot;Ishtar, the queen of heaven&quot;; Ezek. 8:13-14: &quot;weeping for Tammuz&quot;.

In addition, it was the time of census (v. 1), when everybody had to travel (v. 3), and this normally happened during the warm seasons.

This is the opposite to who he&#39;d been before.

It is overlooked that the rich man in this parable is a Jew in hell: he addresses Abraham as &quot;Father&quot;, and Abraham calls him his &quot;Child&quot;. A child of Abraham in hell was beyond the Pharisees&#39; thinking. (MacArhur)</span></p><p class="c2"><span>16:15: How did they manage to look righteous in the eyes of men? The answer is in the second part of the verse: because their definition of &ldquo;righteousness&rdquo; matched the way people expected a righteous person to look like. Jesus essentially says that Pharisees managed to look righteous only because what they offered was highly esteemed among people. In other words, supply fully matches demand. Had people understood righteousness the God&rsquo;s way, Pharisees would have never succeeded.

That is why </span><span class="c0">Nathanael </span><span>(from Cana, a few miles to the south) asked </span><span class="c0">Philip</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;that question. Nathanael was not given to maligning his neighbors (v. 47, &quot;no guile&quot;), but he was shocked that the one &quot;of whom Moses wrote&quot; (v. 45) actually could come from such a disreputable place as Nazareth. (MacArthur)</span></p><p class="c2"><span>1:48: </span><span class="c0">Nathanael</span><span>&nbsp;must have had some intense moments under that </span><span class="c0">fig tree</span><span class="c4">, and he must have been sure that only God could&#39;ve heard him &mdash; because when he learns that Jesus saw him, he calls Jesus &ldquo;Son of God&quot;.</span></p><p class="c2"><span>1:48: </span><span class="c0">Under a fig tree</span><span class="c4">. What&rsquo;s he doing under a fig tree?<br>Basically in Palestine, fig trees were planted around houses as well as places where they would be harvested as a crop. And a fig tree is tall and wide, and provided a very great shade area. And in many of the poorer homes, there was only one room and there was little breeze very often, and so you could go out under the fig tree and you could find shade and comfort and coolness. But beyond that, a fig tree became the only place you could go to get away from the house, and the hustle and bustle of what was going on inside. And so, it became a place of retreat. It became a place of respite. &nbsp;It became a place to be alone. It became a place of prayer, and a place of meditation, and a place of contemplation, a place of communing with God, a place of searching the Scripture, a place of quietness. And it may well be that Nathanael was out under the fig tree, as so many Jews did, and he was meditating and he was praying, in the quietness and the solitude, away from the activity of the house. &nbsp;He was seeking God in the privacy of the shade of the fig tree.<br>And Jesus is saying to him: I saw you. &nbsp;I saw you meditating, I saw you seeking, I saw your open heart. &nbsp;I saw you in the secret place, the private place. &nbsp;I saw your true desire. &nbsp;I saw what was there and what you wanted to know, and I&rsquo;m here.<br>Well, here was Nathanael very possibly praying under the fig tree, &ldquo;Lord, show me Your Messiah.&rdquo; &nbsp;And here comes Philip shooting under the branches saying, &ldquo;Nathanael, I found Him, your prayer is answered.&rdquo; &nbsp;He&rsquo;s from Nazareth. &nbsp;And then, Nathanael says, &ldquo;Ah, you&rsquo;ve got to be kidding.&rdquo; Okay. &nbsp;His desire overwhelmed his prejudice and off he went. (MacArthur)</span></p><p class="c2"><span>1:50: </span><span class="c0">Because I said to you, &lsquo;I saw you under the fig tree,&rsquo; do you believe?</span><span>&nbsp;It shouldn&rsquo;t be a question, it&rsquo;s a statement. The reason you believe is because of My omniscience. You were convinced that only God can know everything. My omniscience convinced you who I was. <br>Jesus then says, &ldquo;Listen, </span><span class="c0">you&rsquo;re going to see greater things than that</span><span class="c4">, my friend. You have only just begun to see.&rdquo; He was knocked over by one little act of omniscience. (MacArthur)</span></p><p class="c2"><span>1:51:</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;Angels descending</span><span>. He&rsquo;s saying this: Nathanael, You think you saw divine power in that one act of omniscience? From here on you&rsquo;re going to see stuff going on all the time between heaven and earth. You&rsquo;re going to see heaven open. And he has. Miracle, after miracle, after miracle. (MacArthur)</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c4">2:15: Jesus actually has disrupted the normal functioning of the Temple: animals were sold to be sacrificed, and money-changers enabled foreigners to change their money to the currency accepted by the Temple.</span></p><p class="c2"><span>3:1: The fact that he came </span><span class="c0">at night</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;suggests he was ashamed of being seen with Jesus. (MacArthur)</span></p><p class="c2"><span>3:1: Had he not had a deep, compelling desire to know God&rsquo;s will, he would not have risked coming to Jesus even at night. </span><span class="c0">Nicodemus</span><span>&nbsp;was honest enough to admin his sinfulness. He was a </span><span class="c0">Pharisee</span><span>, a teacher of the law, and a </span><span class="c0">ruler</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;in the Sanhedrin; but he knew in his heart that all of that did not make him right with God. (MacArthur)</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c4">3:2: Even though Nicodemus did not ask a question, Jesus knew the question he had on his heart.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c4">3:2: We are not told specifically what his intentions were in coming to Jesus because his first words were not a question but a testimony. Though he does not state it, the question that was on his mind is implied from his testimony and from Jesus&rsquo; reply. The Lord knew Nicodemus&rsquo; mind and the question he had: Nicodemus wanted to know how to please God, how to be forgiven. How can he be made righteous? how to be redeemed and become a child of God? How can he become part of God&rsquo;s kingdom? (MacArthur)</span></p><p class="c2"><span>3:3: &nbsp;&quot;</span><span class="c0">Water</span><span>&quot; cannot refer to the breaking of water when a person is physically born. Jesus cannot be saying to Nicodemus that a man has to be physically born because it was obvious he&#39;d already passed that test. Secondly, the Jews didn&#39;t call that &quot;water&quot;, they did not have that expression, and we cannot read modern language into it. Other had said that He referred to baptism, but Christian was not even instituted until Acts 2.<br>Remember that Nicodemus was a ruler of the Jews (v. 1), a religious authority. How, then, Nicodemus have understood the saying? As a Christian baptistm? &mdash; No. The answer goes back to Ezekiel 36:25-27: &quot;I will sprinkle clean water on you, and you shall be clean from all your uncleannesses [...] and I will give you a new heart, and a new spirit I will put within you. [...] and cause you to walk in my statutes and be careful to obey my rules&quot;. What Ezekiel is writing there is that the day will come when the Lord will wash your heart, He&#39;ll wash your life, He&#39;ll wash your inner man, He&#39;ll put a new heart in you, and He&#39;ll put His Spirit in you. So when Jesus talks to Nicodemus and says &quot;you must be born </span><span class="c0">of water and the Spirit</span><span class="c4">&quot;, Nicodemus knows immediately that He is saying &quot;I am come to bring the fulfillment of the new covenant promised through Ezekiel&quot;. That&#39;s what Paul would call &quot;the [internal] washing of regeneration and the renewing [that comes by] the Holy Spirit&quot; (Tit 3:5)<br>(MacArthur)</span></p><p class="c2"><span>3:16: There&rsquo;s a </span><span class="c0">faith</span><span>&nbsp;that&rsquo;s temporary, partial, inadequate, that&rsquo;s different than the faith that saves. &nbsp;John 3:16, the word there &ldquo;</span><span class="c0">believe</span><span>&rdquo;, &ldquo;</span><span class="c0">whosoever believes shall not perish</span><span class="c4">,&rdquo; the word &ldquo;believe&rdquo; there is the same word in John 2:24 translated &ldquo;commit &ndash; commit.&rdquo; &nbsp;It&rsquo;s something deeper than just believing facts; it&rsquo;s committing one&rsquo;s life, turning from sin, submitting to Christ, and the Spirit of God works it all and produces a changed life. &nbsp;You see, salvation and saving faith is more than wanting forgiveness, it&rsquo;s more than wanting heaven; it&rsquo;s being willing to turn from sin and submit to Christ. &nbsp;Yet, beloved, shockingly &ndash; and I say that advisedly &ndash; shockingly, there are Bible teachers and preachers in fundamental evangelicalism who do not allow for any connection necessarily between faith and works. &nbsp;And therefore they are forced to receive as genuine virtually every profession of faith, because if there&rsquo;s not necessarily a correlation between faith and works, then any profession is a valid one. <br>(MacArthur)</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c4">3:16: See also note on Jn 14:15 which explains how faith means obedience.</span></p><p class="c2"><span>5:25: Spiritually </span><span class="c0">dead</span><span>&nbsp;&mdash; those currently dead in sin &mdash; </span><span class="c0">will</span><span>&nbsp;come to </span><span class="c0">life</span><span class="c4">.

How would Philip pass this test, or fail? How could he possibly have known what Jesus </span><span class="c0">would do</span><span class="c4">?

And indeed, a boy came forth who had some food (v. 9)</span></p><p class="c2"><span>6:8: </span><span class="c0">Andrew</span><span class="c4">. In all the incidents that we see Andrew involved in, he is always doing the same thing: he&#39;s bringing people to Christ. He brought his brother Peter, he brought the boy with the fishes. He even did not hesitate to bring gentiles to Christ: this tells us about the openness of his heart, he probably thought that there is no one who Christ would not want to see. He also had faith: we do not know what he was thinking about when he brought this boy with some crackers and pickled fish, but he definitely believed that the Lord could do something with that. After all, Andrew had seen Jesus make wine; why couldn&#39;t he make food? (MacArthur)</span></p><p class="c2"><span>6:7-8: Here we see two different approaches. </span><span class="c0">Philip</span><span>&nbsp;has already given up and could only say &ldquo;I do not know&rdquo;, but </span><span class="c0">Andrew</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;attempts to find a solution even in a hopeless situation.<br>This is how faith functions: one accepts the situation, does whatever little thing is possible to do, and then trusts God to do the rest. And this is what Jesus expects: the disciples should start solving the issue, then bring the issue to Him, so that He can miraculously provide for this need.</span></p><p class="c2"><span>6:15: </span><span class="c0">Make him king</span><span class="c4">.

(MacArthur)</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c4">?:?: Compared to the synoptic gospels, it may seem that John is trying to make himself a more distinguished disciple than he actually were: he constantly promotes himself a step further than Peter. The episodes that support this point of view: John is at Jesus&rsquo; chest and passes Peter&rsquo;s question (), John lets Peter into the yard (), John outruns Peter (). But John is not inserting himself into a story. He was one of the three apostles that formed Jesus&rsquo; inner cirle: Peter, James, and John (Among many other examples: Mk 5:37: Jesus allowed no one else in; Mk 14:33: Jesus took the three to Gethsemane; Mt 17:1 Jesus takes the three to His transfiguration). When Paul visited the apostles in Jerusalem, the three were pillars (Gal 2:9). So, John is only elaborating the facts that, for some reason, were not mentioned in synoptic gospels&nbsp;&mdash; of which he, beyond doubt, was informed.</span></p><p class="c2"><span>12:6: &ldquo;</span><span class="c0">because he was a thief</span><span class="c4">.&rdquo; &nbsp;He didn&rsquo;t become one here, he always was one. &nbsp;He was stealing from the thing the whole time, all three years. &nbsp;He was a thief, and he had the bag, and watch this, and the Greek says: &ldquo;He pilfered what was put in it.&rdquo; &nbsp;Can you imagine that kind of a guy? &nbsp;Here&rsquo;s a poor band of people going around doing good, and he was stealing out of their resources, all the while. &nbsp;He had absolutely no love for them, no affection for them. &nbsp;The fact that he didn&rsquo;t know any of them and was from the south, played into the hands of his secrecy very well, they knew nothing about him. &nbsp;And all the while he was stealing out of the bag. (MacArthur)</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c4">13:22: Now, outwardly Judas didn&rsquo;t appear to have defective character. &nbsp;I&rsquo;m sure of that. &nbsp;In fact, he must have had qualities and capacities which commended him. &nbsp;Three years, he was with the disciples, and Jesus said in the upper room in, in John 13, He said: &ldquo;One of you will betray Me.&rdquo; &nbsp;And all the Apostles responded. &nbsp;Do you remember how they responded? &nbsp;Did they say, &ldquo;Is it Judas?&rdquo; &nbsp;No. &nbsp;Every one of them said, &ldquo;Is it I?&rdquo; &nbsp;Why? &nbsp;They had no more reason to suspect Judas then they had reason to suspect themselves. &nbsp;They knew better about themselves and they assumed better about Judas. &nbsp;He was a fantastic hypocrite. &nbsp;He was so good at it, they elected him treasurer of the group. &nbsp;That&rsquo;s right. &nbsp;They gave him the money. &nbsp;That&rsquo;s how much they trusted him. (MacArthur)</span></p><p class="c2"><span>13:26: </span><span class="c0">Iscariot</span><span class="c4">. That is simply a geographical identification. &nbsp;Why is it that Judas is identified geographically, and the other 11 are not? &nbsp;It&rsquo;s important, because he is the only non-Galilean. &nbsp;He is the only Jew from the southern section. &nbsp;He is the only Judean Jew. &nbsp;All of the rest came from Galilee. &nbsp;And this may indicate to us that from the very beginning, Judas was never really one of the boys. &nbsp;Also, the southern Jews felt themselves greatly superior to the rural Jews of the north, and would have looked down on them. &nbsp;And consequently there may have been a certain amount of pride involved which deepened as time went on. (MacArthur)</span></p><p class="c2"><span>13:26: He said, &ldquo;</span><span class="c0">The one to whom I give the sop, he it is who betrays Me</span><span class="c4">.&rdquo; &nbsp;Sop was a piece of bread that you stuck in a bowl, and in the bowl was a sort of a paste-like jam made out of fruit and nuts. &nbsp;And you took the bread and just sort of soaked it in that, and it was common in the Orient to honor a guest and the meal, and the one who was the honored guest would be the one to whom the host gave the sop. &nbsp;The host would dip it and give it to the honored guest. &nbsp;And He said the one to whom I give the sop, he it is that betrays Me. &nbsp;And He dipped the sop and gave it to Judas. &nbsp;And at that very moment He was honoring him, He was respecting him, He was showing love to him. (MacArthur)</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c4">13:27: Christ could have transformed Judas, if his heart had been willing. &nbsp;He was the same raw material; he was no more unqualified than anybody else. &nbsp;But the same sun that melts the wax, hardens the clay, and while the other men were being melted and molded, he was being hardened. (MacArthur)</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c4">13:30: Apparently, Judas was attracted to Jesus, that&rsquo;s obvious. &nbsp;He followed Him. &nbsp;He stayed with Him. &nbsp;And he stayed with Him longer than a lot of the other false disciples who bailed out much earlier than this. &nbsp;In fact, in John 6, you remember last week I said that there were many disciples who followed Jesus, but when He demanded total commitment out of them it says, &ldquo;And many of His disciples walked no more with Him.&rdquo; &nbsp;But the 12, it says, remained. &nbsp;So, even when Jesus called for all-out commitment, even when He said you must eat My flesh and drink My blood, even when He made total demands on them and many of them left, Judas stuck it out. &nbsp;He stayed. &nbsp;And so, he was definitely attracted to Jesus. &nbsp;I don&rsquo;t think he was particularly attracted by the spiritual, I think he was attracted on the selfish level. &nbsp;I don&rsquo;t think it was really Jesus alone that drew him; I think it was what Jesus could do for him that drew him. &nbsp;He saw the power of Jesus, and he believed that this man would bring the Kingdom. &nbsp;And he was not interested in the Kingdom for the Kingdom&rsquo;s sake or for Christ&rsquo;s sake; he was interested in the Kingdom for what he might gain from it if he were on the inner circle. &nbsp;So, he&rsquo;s totally motivated by selfishness. &nbsp;But nonetheless he followed, in a half-hearted way. (MacArthur)</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c4">14:15: W.E. Vine said regarding faith, &ldquo;It is a firm conviction; it is a personal surrender, and conduct inspired by such surrender.&rdquo; &nbsp;And he was commenting on the term pisteu, to believe. &nbsp;In fact he compares peith and pisteu, closely related etymologically. &nbsp;The difference in meaning is that the former implies what the latter produces, obedience and faith. &nbsp;He says, &ldquo;When a man obeys God, he gives the only possible evidence that in his heart he believes God.&rdquo; &nbsp;Did you get that? &nbsp;&ldquo;When a man obeys God, he gives the only possible evidence that in his heart he believes God.&rdquo; &nbsp;I mean, what good is it for you to stand there and say, &ldquo;I believe God, I believe God, I believe God; I just don&rsquo;t care what He says?&rdquo; &nbsp;Oh? &nbsp;He says, &ldquo;Peith in the New Testament suggests an actual outward result of the inward persuasion and consequence of faith.&rdquo; <br>Faith obeys. &nbsp;Oh, it doesn&rsquo;t perfectly obey, does it? &nbsp;Your faith doesn&rsquo;t perfectly obey. &nbsp;It longs to obey, and it does obey, but it doesn&rsquo;t perfectly obey. &nbsp;Romans 7, Paul says, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t do what I want to do, and I do what I don&rsquo;t want to do, and I fight the battle of my flesh. &nbsp;But the wishing&rdquo; &ndash; I love this in verse 18, Romans 7 &ndash; &ldquo;the wishing is present with me; it wants to obey, it longs to obey, it hungers to obey.&rdquo; &nbsp;To believe is to obey. <br>(MacArthur)</span></p><p class="c2"><span>16:12: </span><span class="c0">But you cannot bear</span><span class="c4">: a person can only accept &quot;&#1074; &#1084;&#1077;&#1088;&#1091; &#1074;&#1086;&#1079;&#1088;&#1072;&#1089;&#1090;&#1072; &#1061;&#1088;&#1080;&#1089;&#1090;&#1086;&#1074;&#1072;&quot;</span></p><p class="c2"><span>17:4: Jesus said He </span><span class="c0">has accomplished</span><span class="c4">, even though He was not crucified yet!</span></p><p class="c2"><span>18:10: When </span><span class="c0">Peter</span><span>&nbsp;used his </span><span class="c0">sword</span><span>, he was not trying to </span><span class="c0">cut off</span><span>&nbsp;Malcus&rsquo; </span><span class="c0">ear</span><span class="c4">; he was going for his head!

The Temple was destroyed in 70 A.D., and 30 A.D. is the year when Jesus was crucified. During these 40 years that priests were continuing their service, other signs were observed. The menorah (lamp of presence: signified presence of the Lord in their midst), every night for forty years, went out, and this in spite of the priests each evening preparing in a special way the western lamp so that it would remain constantly burning all night! &ldquo;...become white; nor did the western most light shine [(the menorah)]; and the doors of the Hekel [Temple] would open by themselves&rdquo; (Soncino version, Yoma 39b).</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c4">7:7: Sin cannot be overcome without the grace of God, so the law was given to convert the soul by anxiety about its guilt, so that it might be ready to receive grace (St. Augustine)</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c4">8:16: &mdash; I don&#39;t know, can&#39;t explain it, but I just feel (in my spirit) that something has changed and I&#39;m a different person now.

It was a belief many of the Corinthian believers had reverted to, or had never given up, in order to justify their sexual misconduct. Apparently, they were arguing that sex is simply a biological act, no different morally from eating or sleeping, but Paul strongly refutes that idea. The body is more than biological, as divine judgment will reveal. It is a member of Christ, therefore never to be used for any purpose that dishonors the God who made and indwells it. Christians should have but one response to sexual temptation: running away from it (v. 18).

But what does &quot;</span><span class="c0">falling</span><span class="c4">&quot; signify? Temporary sin, or permanent loss of salvation? In v.5 Paul speaks about Israel, but by using so many Christian symbols, he hints at Christian believers, saying, that although many were baptized, and many partook of Christ, drinking His water (the Spirit) and eating His food (righteousness?), some of them have fallen off.</span></p><p class="c2"><span>Verses 6 to 11 describe the dangers that Paul is taking about in v.12, that lead to </span><span class="c0">falling</span><span class="c4">.

Paul&#39;s point is, if a woman in church has taken the veil off, she may as well go the whole way and shave her whole head, joining the protesters, because you&#39;ve done as much. Basically, Paul says, &quot;you can&#39;t do that&quot;, because your society maintains a distinction between men and women, which is ordained by God (Dt&nbsp;22:5: do not wear men&#39;s clothing, and vice versa), and you are to support this distinction. (MacArthur)</span></p><p class="c2"><span>12:31: </span><span class="c0">A more excellent way</span><span class="c4">. In other words, a more excellent way than coveting the showy gift is to be content with the one you have. A more excellent way than lording it over somebody because you happen to have the gift of speaking or teaching, or whatever, or languages. A more excellent way than being proud is to be loving, and that&rsquo;s what he talks about in 13 as he describes in beautiful language the more excellent way, which is love.<br>The Corinthian church had the gifts. The Corinthian church had a lot of things going on, had a lot of activity, but without love it wasn&rsquo;t excellent; it was counterfeit. And they were selfish, and self-seeking, and operating in the flesh. And so chapter 13 sums up the more excellent way; not conflict in the body, not struggle, not self-seeking, not pride, not even envy, not even jealousy. None of those things have a place, only love, only love.<br>The truly spiritual life is the only life in which spiritual gifts can truly operate &ndash; okay? &ndash; and the truly spiritual life is not controlled by the gifts of the Spirit, it is controlled by the fruit of the Spirit. If you don&rsquo;t have the fruit of the Spirit, then the gifts of the Spirit are functioning in the flesh. If there&rsquo;s no love there, then what is coming off and what is being done is being done without the fruit of the Spirit; and if it&rsquo;s being done without the fruit of the Spirit, it&rsquo;s being done without the Spirit. It&rsquo;s in the flesh, it&rsquo;s fleshly, it&rsquo;s carnal, it&rsquo;s counterfeit. <br>(MacArthur)</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c4">13:1: Keep in mind that it&#39;s not just a nice wedding text that Paul has written; he was addressing a troubled church, where people have forgotten about loving one another.</span></p><p class="c2"><span>13:2: </span><span class="c0">I am nothing.</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;t doesn&rsquo;t matter what you do. It doesn&rsquo;t matter what I do. It&rsquo;s nothing. It adds up to nothing. In fact, interesting to look at, verse 1 says, &ldquo;The loveless person produces nothing of value, just noise.&rdquo; Verse 2 says, &ldquo;The loveless person is himself of no value.&rdquo; &ldquo;I am nothing.&rdquo; Third verse, &ldquo;The loveless person receives nothing of value.&rdquo; &ldquo;It profits me nothing.&rdquo; Just a big nothing. Life minus love equals zero. (MacArthur)</span></p><p class="c2"><span>13:3: </span><span class="c0">Deliver up my body to be burned</span><span class="c4">. It&rsquo;s an interesting discussion about what it means to give your body to be burned. Some think it means to become a slave. In those days, when you became a slave they branded you with a hot iron that burned your flesh. And some say Paul is saying here, &ldquo;Even if I became a slave, it wouldn&rsquo;t matter.&rdquo; That&rsquo;s possible. But in line with the ultimate nature of Paul&rsquo;s discussion here, it would seem to me that the epitome of what he would say would be, &ldquo;If I would give my life to be burned, it wouldn&rsquo;t matter.&rdquo;<br>Now the argument against that is some people say, &ldquo;Well, there was no precedent for that since that didn&rsquo;t go on in that day.&rdquo; Well, that&rsquo;s true. There was not a burning-at-the-stake persecution at the time of Paul; that came later, and Christians were burned at the stake.<br>But there are several ways to look at it. One, he could have been referring to the burning that was going to come. And he could have been, by virtue of the insight of the Holy Spirit, been looking forward to those many Christians who were going to die at the stake for the wrong reasons. You know, one of the interesting things about the early martyrdom of the church was that many of those Christians developed a martyr complex, and they wanted to die as martyrs in order to become famous like other Christians who had died as martyrs. Now maybe he was anticipating that in the mind of the Spirit.<br>There&rsquo;s another possibility too. There were some in the past who gave their lives to be burned: Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego. Though God delivered them, they were willing. But also, interestingly, right in the city near Corinth, the city of Athens, there was a tomb called the Indian&rsquo;s tomb. A certain Indian had gone in that very spot, and had lit himself on fire and burned himself to death after he had written his epitaph. They built a monument there and this is what it said: &ldquo;Zarmanochegas, an Indian from Bargosa, according to the traditional customs of the Indians, made himself immortal, and lies here.&rdquo; So here was a guy who burned his body to gain some religious immortality.<br>(MacArthur)</span></p><p class="c2"><span>13:4: &#1055;&#1088;&#1086;&#1087;&#1086;&#1074;&#1077;&#1076;&#1100; &#1052;&#1072;&#1082;&#1040;&#1088;&#1090;&#1091;&#1088;&#1072; &#1085;&#1072; &#1088;&#1091;&#1089;&#1089;&#1082;&#1086;&#1084;: &#1089;&#1084;. </span><span class="c1 c6"><a class="c8" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://docs.google.com/document/d/1xuYSQvOAeMpBYUSRYeFJLLT8hQHX9iSXTUINCff1-ZI/edit%23heading%3Dh.62h1jx2d4b9h&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1582399365488000">&#1041;&#1080;&#1073;&#1083;&#1080;&#1103; &#1047;&#1072;&#1084;&#1077;&#1090;&#1082;&#1080; &#1080; &#1048;&#1089;&#1089;&#1083;&#1077;&#1076;&#1086;&#1074;&#1072;&#1085;&#1080;&#1103;, &#1051;&#1102;&#1073;&#1086;&#1074;&#1100; (1 &#1050;&#1086;&#1088; 13; &#1052;&#1072;&#1082;&#1040;&#1088;&#1090;&#1091;&#1088;)</a></span></p><p class="c2"><span>13:4: (</span><span class="c1">not romantic/friendly love</span><span>) Which sorts of love are </span><span class="c3">not</span><span>&nbsp;in view here?</span><span>&nbsp;The word &ldquo;</span><span class="c0">love</span><span class="c4">&rdquo; does never mean romantic or sexual love: in Greek, there&rsquo;s another word for that, and it&rsquo;s never used in the NT. For example, when it says in Ephesians 5, &ldquo;Husbands, love your wives,&rdquo; it isn&rsquo;t talking about romance. <br>&ldquo;Love&rdquo; in the Bible never means emotional love. He&rsquo;s not saying the greatest of these is sentimentality. That too is not scriptural love.<br>It does not mean a friendly spirit of tolerance and brotherhood toward others, no matter what the convictions are; not the love that says &ldquo;as long as there&rsquo;s some common ground; we just got to love them all.&rdquo;.<br>What is love? Love is an act of self-sacrifice. Love is not a feeling.<br>(MacArthur)</span></p><p class="c2"><span>13:4: (</span><span class="c1">love is a verb</span><span class="c4">) The Bible never defines love. It never defines love in terms of abstracts, in terms of attitudes, in terms of feelings, in terms of ideology. It never defines love, it only describes love in action; because love is not an abstract, love is not a feeling. Love is not really an attitude; love is a deed, love is an activity.<br>In vv.4-7, English words are adjectives, but in the Greek, there are all verbs. And verbs describe action. <br>Love is not something you describe with adjectives; love is something you describe as it functions. Love is only love when it acts; and that&rsquo;s the way it&rsquo;s presented in the Word of God.<br>(MacArthur)</span></p><p class="c2"><span>13:4: </span><span class="c0">Love is patient</span><span>. Love is patient. This Greek word (</span><span class="c3">makrothume&#333;</span><span>) </span><span class="c4">describes patience with people (not with circumstances). It is the ability to be wronged and wronged again and wronged again, and have the power to strike back but never even think of it. It describes the person who never ever gets angry. <br>That&rsquo;s something new to the Greeks: they would&#39;ve never considered this to be a virtue; long-suffering for them is a weakness. In our days we also see people who strike back as courageous and manly. But The Christian is one who loves in response.<br>(MacArthur)</span></p><p class="c2"><span>13:4: Love is </span><span class="c0">patient</span><span>, like God. Robert Ingersoll, the brilliant atheist &ndash; if any atheist could be classified as brilliant &ndash; lived in the last century, and he stopped, as he used to like to do, in the middle of one of his lectures against God, and he took out his watch and he held it up to his audience and he says, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll give God five minutes to strike me dead for the things I&rsquo;ve said.&rdquo; That&rsquo;s the way he use to mock God.<br>Well, he wasn&rsquo;t struck dead. And somebody told this incident to the great Christian, Theodore Parker; and Parker smiled and said this, quote: &ldquo;And did the gentlemen think he could exhaust the patience of the eternal God in five minutes?&rdquo; (MacArthur)</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c27">13:4: &#1051;&#1102;&#1073;&#1086;&#1074;&#1100; </span><span class="c0 c27">&#1076;&#1086;&#1083;&#1075;&#1086;&#1090;&#1077;&#1088;&#1087;&#1080;&#1090;</span><span class="c18">, &#1082;&#1072;&#1082; &#1041;&#1086;&#1075;. &#1056;&#1086;&#1073;&#1077;&#1088;&#1090; &#1048;&#1085;&#1075;&#1077;&#1088;&#1089;&#1086;&#1083;&#1083;, &#1074;&#1077;&#1083;&#1080;&#1082;&#1086;&#1083;&#1077;&#1087;&#1085;&#1099;&#1081; &#1072;&#1090;&#1077;&#1080;&#1089;&#1090; &mdash; &#1077;&#1089;&#1083;&#1080; &#1082;&#1072;&#1082;&#1086;&#1081;-&#1083;&#1080;&#1073;&#1086; &#1072;&#1090;&#1077;&#1080;&#1089;&#1090; &#1074;&#1086;&#1086;&#1073;&#1097;&#1077; &#1084;&#1086;&#1078;&#1077;&#1090; &#1073;&#1099;&#1090;&#1100; &#1085;&#1072;&#1079;&#1074;&#1072;&#1085; &quot;&#1074;&#1077;&#1083;&#1080;&#1082;&#1086;&#1083;&#1077;&#1087;&#1085;&#1099;&#1084;&quot; &mdash; &#1074;&#1099;&#1089;&#1090;&#1091;&#1087;&#1072;&#1083; &#1074; &#1087;&#1088;&#1086;&#1096;&#1083;&#1086;&#1084; &#1074;&#1077;&#1082;&#1077;. &#1042;&#1086; &#1074;&#1088;&#1077;&#1084;&#1103; &#1086;&#1076;&#1085;&#1086;&#1081; &#1080;&#1079; &#1089;&#1074;&#1086;&#1080;&#1093; &#1083;&#1077;&#1082;&#1094;&#1080;&#1081; &#1087;&#1088;&#1086;&#1090;&#1080;&#1074; &#1074;&#1077;&#1088;&#1099; &#1080; &#1041;&#1086;&#1075;&#1072; &#1086;&#1085; &#1087;&#1086; &#1089;&#1074;&#1086;&#1077;&#1084;&#1091; &#1086;&#1073;&#1099;&#1082;&#1085;&#1086;&#1074;&#1077;&#1085;&#1080;&#1102; &#1089;&#1076;&#1077;&#1083;&#1072;&#1083; &#1087;&#1072;&#1091;&#1079;&#1091;, &#1087;&#1088;&#1080;&#1083;&#1102;&#1076;&#1085;&#1086; &#1076;&#1086;&#1089;&#1090;&#1072;&#1083; &#1095;&#1072;&#1089;&#1099;, &#1080; &#1079;&#1072;&#1103;&#1074;&#1080;&#1083;: &quot;&#1071; &#1076;&#1072;&#1102; &#1041;&#1086;&#1075;&#1091; &#1087;&#1103;&#1090;&#1100; &#1084;&#1080;&#1085;&#1091;&#1090;, &#1095;&#1090;&#1086;&#1073;&#1099; &#1087;&#1086;&#1088;&#1072;&#1079;&#1080;&#1090;&#1100; &#1084;&#1077;&#1085;&#1103; &#1085;&#1072;&#1089;&#1084;&#1077;&#1088;&#1090;&#1100; &#1079;&#1072; &#1089;&#1083;&#1086;&#1074;&#1072;, &#1082;&#1086;&#1090;&#1086;&#1088;&#1099;&#1077; &#1103; &#1090;&#1086;&#1083;&#1100;&#1082;&#1086; &#1095;&#1090;&#1086; &#1089;&#1082;&#1072;&#1079;&#1072;&#1083;!&quot;. &#1058;&#1072;&#1082; &#1086;&#1085; &#1076;&#1088;&#1072;&#1079;&#1085;&#1080;&#1083; &#1041;&#1086;&#1075;&#1072;.<br>&#1053;&#1091;... &#1089;&#1084;&#1077;&#1088;&#1090;&#1100; &#1077;&#1075;&#1086; &#1085;&#1077; &#1087;&#1086;&#1088;&#1072;&#1079;&#1080;&#1083;&#1072;. &#1046;&#1080;&#1083; &#1089;&#1077;&#1073;&#1077; &#1089;&#1087;&#1086;&#1082;&#1086;&#1081;&#1085;&#1086;.<br>&#1050;&#1086;&#1075;&#1076;&#1072; &#1078;&#1077; &#1086;&#1073; &#1101;&#1090;&#1086;&#1084; &#1101;&#1087;&#1080;&#1079;&#1086;&#1076;&#1077; &#1088;&#1072;&#1089;&#1089;&#1082;&#1072;&#1079;&#1072;&#1083;&#1080; &#1080;&#1079;&#1074;&#1077;&#1089;&#1090;&#1085;&#1086;&#1084;&#1091; &#1093;&#1088;&#1080;&#1089;&#1090;&#1080;&#1072;&#1085;&#1080;&#1085;&#1091;, &#1058;&#1077;&#1086;&#1076;&#1086;&#1088;&#1091; &#1055;&#1072;&#1088;&#1082;&#1077;&#1088;&#1091;, &#1090;&#1086;&#1090; &#1091;&#1083;&#1099;&#1073;&#1085;&#1091;&#1083;&#1089;&#1103;, &#1080; &#1089;&#1082;&#1072;&#1079;&#1072;&#1083;: &quot;&#1048; &#1095;&#1090;&#1086; &#1078;&#1077;, &#1101;&#1090;&#1086;&#1090; &#1076;&#1078;&#1077;&#1085;&#1090;&#1083;&#1100;&#1084;&#1077;&#1085; &#1074;&#1089;&#1077;&#1088;&#1100;&#1105;&#1079; &#1089;&#1095;&#1080;&#1090;&#1072;&#1083;, &#1095;&#1090;&#1086; &#1084;&#1086;&#1078;&#1077;&#1090; &#1080;&#1089;&#1095;&#1077;&#1088;&#1087;&#1072;&#1090;&#1100; &#1090;&#1077;&#1088;&#1087;&#1077;&#1085;&#1080;&#1077; &#1074;&#1077;&#1095;&#1085;&#1086;&#1075;&#1086; &#1041;&#1086;&#1075;&#1072; &#1079;&#1072; &#1082;&#1072;&#1082;&#1080;&#1093;-&#1090;&#1086; &#1087;&#1103;&#1090;&#1100; &#1084;&#1080;&#1085;&#1091;&#1090;?&quot; (&#1052;&#1072;&#1082;&#1040;&#1088;&#1090;&#1091;&#1088;)</span></p><p class="c2"><span>13:4: </span><span class="c0">Love is kind</span><span>. We just spoke about patience, or long-suffering, and now here is kindness. Look: long-suffering endures the injuries of others, and kindness </span><span class="c3">pays them back</span><span>,</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;only with good deeds. Long-suffering says, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll take anything from my enemies.&rdquo; Kindness says, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll give anything. To my enemies, to meet their need.&rdquo; Now that&rsquo;s the essence of it: kindness is just the other side. <br>The root word in the Greek is &ldquo;useful&rdquo;. &ldquo;I will do anything that will be of use to my enemy, that will be of use to another. I will live my life to benefit others.&rdquo; This is what kindness is: love is useful to other people. It&rsquo;s not a sweet attitude when you feel good about others; love is the deed of kindness. It&rsquo;s the act that you do for someone else that they need done.<br>(MacArthur)</span></p><p class="c2"><span>13:4: </span><span class="c0">Love does not envy</span><span class="c4">. Jealousy exists on two levels. A superficial jealousy thinks: &ldquo;I want what he has.&rdquo; But a deeper jealousy will think, &ldquo;I wish he didn&rsquo;t have it.&rdquo; The first thing is you want it, and the second is you resent that he has it. <br>To envy in Greek comes from a root that means &ldquo;to boil&rdquo;: it&rsquo;s the inner boiling, seething, steaming over somebody else&rsquo;s success, somebody else&rsquo;s beauty. <br>But love is not envying. When love sees somebody who&rsquo;s prosperous or popular, when love sees somebody who&rsquo;s powerful or rich or beautiful or gifted, &mdash; love is glad for them and love rejoices.<br>This is how love works: a loving person rejoices in the excellencies of others. In the beauty of others. In the winsomeness of others. In the success of others. In the gifts of others. Holds no jealousy.<br>(MacArthur)</span></p><p class="c2"><span>13:4: </span><span class="c0">Love does not boast</span><span>. The idea of bragging is to make somebody else feel like you are superior to them. And believe me, that is the opposite of love, because love says &ldquo;I want </span><span class="c3">you</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;to feel superior, and I&rsquo;ll take the role of a servant&rdquo;. Boasting is geared to wound someone else, to make you stand out and make them look inferior. But love never brags. Love never blows its own horn. <br>Somebody said, &ldquo;Empty trucks make the most noise&rdquo;. And let&rsquo;s face it, nobody really likes people like that because they are loveless people. You know, when you get somebody around you like that, you don&rsquo;t want to fellowship with them, you want to leave, or wish they did.<br>But what love does? While a prideful person can&rsquo;t stop talking about himself, thinking &ldquo;I&rsquo;m better than you, and I want everybody to know all about me,&rdquo;... Love says, &ldquo;I wish I could know all about you.&rdquo;. <br>(MacArthur)</span></p><p class="c2"><span>13:4: </span><span class="c0">Love is not arrogant</span><span>. Arrogance always goes together with boasting. </span><span class="c0">Boasting</span><span>&nbsp;represents the verbalizing of pride, the actual speech of pride, the actual action of pride, but </span><span class="c0">conceit</span><span>&nbsp;(being arrogant) is the attitude of pride. Conceit is the down side of boasting, the inner attitude that results in the windbag mouth.<br>The word for </span><span class="c0">arrogant</span><span>&nbsp;(Gk. phusio&#333;) means &ldquo;blowing&rdquo;, like what you do with a balloon. That&rsquo;s what &ldquo;puffed up&rdquo; comes from. And when a person is &ldquo;blown up&rdquo;, he has an exaggerated self-image, and all that hot air has to come out. A puffed up person tends to be a windbag as well. Those two come together.<br>But all that pride ever does is breed contention. All it does is ever start fights. Humility has never started a fight yet. Humble people haven&rsquo;t got anything to argue about. They give.<br>You know, love is not big-headed; </span><span class="c3">love is big-hearted</span><span class="c4">! A love is superior to eloquence, to spiritual insight, to knowledge, to faith, to charity and martyrdom, love which suffers long and is kind.<br>(MacArthur)</span></p><p class="c2"><span>13:5: </span><span class="c0">Love is not rude</span><span class="c4">. Love doesn&rsquo;t behave rudely. This is such a practical thing. The verb here means &ldquo;to behave in an unbecoming, unfitting, inappropriate manner&rdquo;. Poor manners, rudeness. This is the opposite of love, because when a person has poor manners and is rude, he&rsquo;s essentially declaring that &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t love you because I could care less what affects you. I will do what I want whether you like it or not!&rdquo;<br>A person who is not willing to discipline his behavior with others in mind is totally self-centered. Love is never rude because love is always lost in how its actions affect somebody else.<br>(MacArthur)</span></p><p class="c2"><span>13:5: </span><span class="c0">Love does not insist on its own way</span><span class="c4">. By definition, love is not aimed at oneself. Love is always aimed towards others. If not, it is not love.<br>This is probably the key to everything. &ldquo;Love seeks not its own&rdquo;. It&rsquo;s the opposite of self-seeking. Love isn&rsquo;t interested in its own things, love never seeks its own. Love is interested in the things of another person, love is always seeking somebody else&rsquo;s. <br>Lenski, the great commentator, said this. He said, &ldquo;Cure selfishness and you&rsquo;ve just replanted the Garden of Eden.&rdquo;<br>This is &ndash; this is the key to the whole concept of love. It is selflessness. You&rsquo;re patient with people. You&rsquo;re kind with people. You&rsquo;re not jealous of people. You&rsquo;re not angry with people. You&rsquo;re not upset with people. You&rsquo;re not provoked by people. You&rsquo;re very tolerant with people. You&rsquo;re very generous with people. You&rsquo;re very gracious with people. You&rsquo;re never rude to people. All of that means you&rsquo;re selfless.<br>(MacArthur)</span></p><p class="c2"><span>13:5: </span><span class="c0">Love is not irritable</span><span class="c4">. Love is not provoked. The Greek word means a sudden outburst. Love never gets upset. Never gets irritated. Love is never is ready to fight. Never gets mad at other people.<br>Next time you get upset at home and you get mad, remember this: the reason you&rsquo;re angry is because you don&rsquo;t love the person you&rsquo;re angry at. Because when you got angry, you said what you shouldn&rsquo;t have said and you wounded them. And the reason you wounded them is because you wanted to wound them. And you know what? You decided &ldquo;I want my way and I want it the way I want it. And if you don&rsquo;t do it the way I want it, I&rsquo;m going to hurt you.&rdquo; <br>You see, you say things that will never be forgotten. They leave scars. You do things that hurt and injure. Because at that moment, you don&rsquo;t love that person. You&rsquo;re more concerned about yourself than anything. If you have a problem getting irritated and upset, if you have a problem getting angry, getting mad, losing your control, losing your temper, it&rsquo;s because you have a mindset that is selfish. In other words, your whole preoccupation is self-centered. You have a preset in your mind to determine that you are the one who matters.<br>You see, love bears the injuries suffered at the hands of others without any irritation because love is so totally selfless. It never gets on the defensive. It never defends itself. Love would feel the pain, love would suffer, but for that sensitivity it won&rsquo;t issue an irritated, upset, angry, uncontrolled conduct. That is not Christlike.<br>Granville Walker said, &ldquo;Love is the only cure for irritability, for irritability is only another manifestation of self-centeredness, and love that takes a man outside himself and centers the focus of his attention on the wellbeing of others is its only cure.&rdquo; The sooner you learn that the thing that matters is everybody else, the less problem you&rsquo;re going to have with what happens to your rights. So love is not upset, not irritated. It never gets angry.<br>Love suffers everything without irritation and without exasperation, unless it&rsquo;s defending God. But when it comes to self, it takes it. <br>(MacArthur)</span></p><p class="c2"><span>13:5: </span><span class="c0">Love is not resentful</span><span class="c4">. Love remembers no evil. The word &ldquo;remember&rdquo; in greek is an accountant&rsquo;s word that literally means &ldquo;to keep a mathematical calculation&rdquo;, a ledger of a bookkeeper. And the reason you write things in a bookkeeper&rsquo;s ledger is so that you won&rsquo;t forget them. And what he&rsquo;s saying here is love never keeps books on the evil done to it. Love never keeps a running record of everybody&rsquo;s offense. The idea is holding somebody accountable for some wrong or evil or injury. Love just forgives and forgets.<br>Chrysostom, the early church father, had a beautiful thought on this, he said, Love &ldquo;is like a spark that falls into the sea and is quenched&rdquo;. When an injury falls upon a loving Christian, it is drowned just as surely. And that&rsquo;s the way it ought to be, drowned in the sea of love.<br>The very same word is used in the New Testament of the pardoning act of God. He keeps no account. Absolute forgiveness. That&rsquo;s because He loves us, right? God so loved us that He doesn&rsquo;t keep account of our sin, He just forgives it all and keeps on forgiving it and keeps on forgiving it and keeps on forgiving it. So as God has not kept any books on our sin, so are we not to keep any books on the evils of others.<br>But resentment keeps on keeping books about it. And so often we do that. We keep books and we brood over the record, and we read it and we reread it and we take the molehill of somebody&rsquo;s offense and turn it into a mountain of hostility. That&rsquo;s not something we&rsquo;d like to admit, but I&rsquo;m afraid it&rsquo;s true.<br>Love never makes memories out of evils. Love fast forgets and sees past a person&rsquo;s sin to their potential. Love hesitates to believe any rumor. Love always forgives, love never keeps account of wrong. It never gets irritated, as we saw, and it never is resentful. That&rsquo;s love. Do you love like that? That&rsquo;s the way Jesus loved, that&rsquo;s the way we&rsquo;re to love.<br>(MacArthur)</span></p><p class="c2"><span>13:6: </span><span class="c0">Love does not rejoice at wrongdoing</span><span>. Love rejoices not in iniquity. &ldquo;</span><span class="c0">Iniquity</span><span class="c4">&rdquo; simply means &ldquo;unrighteousness&rdquo;, or sin. Love never rejoices in sin. <br>How can anyone rejoice in sin? There are many ways. One way is when a person does something that he knows is bad, but speaks proudly about it. Or a person may have a mindset which tells them that something is acceptable because of this and that reason. Some people can be proud about how many women they had. Others tell stories about how they circumvented the law. Other people may boast in how they masterfully cheated someone. People would rejoice that they have gotten away with something. Some people may even rejoice in another person&rsquo;s sin because it makes them look so much better in comparison! There may be many ways to rejoice in iniquity.<br>Always reminds me of the story of Ernest Hemingway. He told the Playboy magazine that &ldquo;what is immoral is what you feel bad after&rdquo;. But nothing made him feel bad, so by his own standard, he was a man of unimpeachable morals. Ten years later, in the very same magazine, the account of Hemingway&rsquo;s life presented a chronicle of repeated suicide attempts, paranoia, multiple affairs, and a final and successful suicide attempt. Took a bullet and blew his brains out. A person won&rsquo;t rejoice in sin long; only so much.<br>But you can&rsquo;t rejoice in iniquity if you love. You know why? <br>Speaking of love towards God, one cannot rejoice in things that are sinful because iniquity affronts God. Basic rule: if you love Someone, you don&rsquo;t want Him to be affronted. And a Christian who rejoices in that, or who tolerates that, doesn&rsquo;t understand what it means to love God. Because that is so very offensive to the holiness and the purity of God, that if you really loved God that would just make you feel cold inside, no place for rejoicing. So there&rsquo;s no thought of rejoicing over evil.<br>And when it comes to loving people, it actually means hating their sinfulness. Not persons themselves, not; only the sinfulness they have in them: the habits, the mindset, the thinking, the actions. You can&rsquo;t rejoice in any of it, because if you love that person, you can&#39;t rejoice at seeing that what he does is leading him to destruction. Because all sin leads to destruction: that&rsquo;s one reason sins are sinful. Anxiety and worry would be a much more natural response from a loving person. A loving person would try to help others leave the path of destruction.<br>(MacArthur)</span></p><p class="c2"><span>13:6: </span><span class="c0">Love does not rejoice at wrongdoing</span><span class="c4">. Now look at something that&rsquo;s implied here: this verse hits at the idea of gossip because it gives no room for even recounting evil things. Love would not gossip, because gossip is never kind.<br>And I wonder, how much of our conversation would be silenced if we never gossiped about the faults and sins of other people? What if we didn&rsquo;t read the paper, report the evil all over the place, if we didn&rsquo;t talk about the failures and faults and sins of the people around us, what would we talk about?<br>But look at this. Love does not rejoice in iniquity, and if it does not rejoice in it, it isn&rsquo;t happy to hear it, and it won&rsquo;t be happy to pass it on. Love does not like to hear evil, and it does not want to pass it on.<br>Some people would argue, &ldquo;well, it&rsquo;s the truth we&rsquo;re talking about!&rdquo;. Listen, even if something is true, that does not mean you have to say it. But why would you pass around something that wounds and injures and chastens the person who did it? Why? If you were loving to God and loving to that individual, you wouldn&rsquo;t.<br>I kind of like the definition of gossip that says this. &ldquo;Gossip is vice enjoyed vicariously.&rdquo; But love doesn&rsquo;t do that. Love hates the sin. Love hates the way it hurts God and the way it hurts the sinner.<br>Granville Walker said, &ldquo;There are times when silence is yellow. Times when we ought to stand on our feet and, regardless of the consequences, challenge the gross evils of the time, and these are the times when not to do so is the most blatant form of cowardice. But there are other times when silence is golden, when to tell the truth is to make many hearts bleed needlessly and when nothing is accomplished and everything is hurt by a loose tongue.&rdquo;<br>He&rsquo;s right, of course. You see, love never rejoices in iniquity. It never rejoices in what offends God and breaks God&rsquo;s heart. It never rejoices in what harms the sinner. And so it never likes to hear it, let alone pass it on. <br>(MacArthur)</span></p><p class="c2"><span>13:6: </span><span class="c0">Love rejoices with the truth</span><span>. Love does not rejoice in evil; well, what does love rejoice in? Not it, but </span><span class="c0">with</span><span>. </span><span class="c0">With the truth</span><span class="c4">. It does not rejoice in unrighteousness, but with the truth.<br>Love only rejoices with the truth as taught and lived. Love can&rsquo;t rejoice with error. Love can&rsquo;t rejoice with false teaching. Love can&rsquo;t tolerate wrong doctrine.<br>I can&rsquo;t really enjoy being with a person and approvingly put my hand around him who teaches ungodly things, or who lives a life that goes against that truth, because the behavior of such a person will mess the joy up. Love will rejoice when truth is taught and lived. And believe me, the slightest compromise will take the joy out of love. I may love you, but if you teach error, I will not be able to rejoice about you. I won&rsquo;t be able to, if I love.<br>In 2 John 6 we find an interesting helpful illustration of this: &ldquo;And this is love: that we walk after His commandments&rdquo;. Look, this is love, not a feeling, not an attitude, but obedience to the truth. &ldquo;That what you have heard from the beginning, you walk in&rdquo;. This is love: living God&rsquo;s truth. <br>Love walks after the commandments. Love operates in the area of the commandments, and love responds toward the people who teach the truth. But love doesn&rsquo;t rejoice indiscriminately at anybody and anything who just happens to throw the name God or Jesus around.<br>Love isn&rsquo;t saying, &ldquo;Oh, well, it doesn&rsquo;t matter what you believe&rdquo; or &ldquo;It doesn&rsquo;t matter how you live. We love everybody anyway.&rdquo; No. Love rejoices in seeing that others live according to it, and it doesn&rsquo;t otherwise. Love may love a person, but it won&rsquo;t rejoice if that person lives in error. <br>Will love go around finding faults in people? No; love won&rsquo;t be looking for faults in people, but rather, for their goodness. Love won&rsquo;t subtract from people&rsquo;s reputation, but will look for ways to add to it. Jesus could see in the life of a harlot (who washed his feet with penitent tears; Lk 7:36-50) a plus, when the Pharisee could see nothing but a minus. <br>Love looks for the truth and the true behavior and it rejoices. And by rejoicing when there&rsquo;s good behavior, it encourages that good behavior.<br>(MacArthur)</span></p><p class="c2"><span>13:7: </span><span class="c0">Love bears, believes, hopes, endures all things</span><span class="c4">. After the eleven actions of love here comes the crescendo: the final four elements of love. Paul is really sort of flying by now, and they really kind of gather up some of the others as well. These four are ascending as we&rsquo;re going from one to the next, and they&rsquo;re closely tied. They just really go together.<br>(MacArthur)</span></p><p class="c2"><span>13:7: </span><span class="c0">All things</span><span class="c4">. These statements are hyperbole: all things is not given in a universal sense; it&rsquo;s an exaggeration. Love certainly has to make some discrimination. We have to test the spirits to see whether they&rsquo;re of God. We won&rsquo;t believe the devil, will we? Paul means &ldquo;all things&rdquo; within the limitations of proper biblical boundaries, proper Christian discrimnation, proper Christian sensibility. All things that come into the divine framework. (MacArthur)</span></p><p class="c2"><span>13:7: </span><span class="c0">Love bears all things</span><span>. Let&rsquo;s look at the first one. This is a tremendous word and I want you to see the depth of it. The word &ldquo;</span><span class="c0">bear</span><span class="c4">&rdquo; primarily means &ldquo;to cover with silence&rdquo;, or in one word, &ldquo;to suppress&rdquo; (also: &ldquo;to conceal&rdquo;, &ldquo;ward off&rdquo;, &ldquo;endure patiently&rdquo;). It doesn&rsquo;t mean that love puts up with anything and that love can be shoved around because it doesn&rsquo;t have any dignity. But what it does mean is that love out of a regard and a respect and an honest concern for the real value of another person, love will do everything it can to cover up and suppress the sin of that person. Genuine love is reluctant to drag a scandal in front of anyone. Love will warn, yes, and love will exhort and love will rebuke and love will discipline, but love will cover, not expose. It is disposed to cover ugliness in someone else&rsquo;s life.<br>In contrast, depravity would normally want to uncover everybody&rsquo;s evil. Just check out the news. True confessions. Dirty secrets of mrs. so-and-so, all women of mr. so-and-so. It&rsquo;s jammed with expos&eacute;s. Depravity is always looking to find the skeleton in somebody else&rsquo;s closet because it gives a sense of self-righteousness, always. <br>You know, I always question people who are married and all they can do is talk about the errors and the faults and the sins of their partner. I question whether they know the meaning of love because love throws a blanket over somebody else&rsquo;s faults. Love throws a kindly mantle over the faults and weaknesses and sins of others. <br>Have you ever noticed how easily you dismiss the faults of those you love? Think of the person you love the most, and they do something wrong. &ldquo;Ah, well, there&rsquo;s so much good about them. I mean everybody makes a mistake.&rdquo; Now think about the person you don&rsquo;t like. Or imagine that you didn&rsquo;t like somebody and they do something wrong. Don&rsquo;t think too long. <br>Love always has this redemptive quality to it which is best evidenced by the cross of Jesus Christ, on which he redeemed from the world from its sins, because God so loved the world. Het is the covering of our sin.Love throws a mantle over sin because love has a redemptive element. Love is always after redemption. Love wants to redeem, it wants to buy back. Love is not judgmental, love is not condemning, love is redeeming.<br>There&rsquo;s more. Love will actually be willing to go beyond throwing a blanket; love is so empathetic that love will be willing to feel the pain if necessary. And then love will redeem and forgive. And take the consequences of sin, if it has to. True love will have that redemptive quality.<br>On the cross, God didn&rsquo;t just throw a mantle over sin, He didn&rsquo;t just feel sympathetic about it, He did what? He bore our sins in His own body. Genuine love is never quick to exploit or expose or gloat or condemn. It throws a blanket over sin, carries the burden of it, even takes the blame for it, even accepts the punishment.<br>Love is not for the half-hearted, you know. Love is not for the sentimental. Love is the most tough, difficult thing there is. It isn&rsquo;t for weaklings, it&rsquo;s only for strength. It takes the most discipline, the most commitment, and the most faith of anything: to live by love.<br>Do we really cover other people&rsquo;s evil? Love does. Love bears all things.<br>(MacArthur)</span></p><p class="c2"><span>13:7: </span><span class="c0">Love believes all things</span><span class="c4">. This is in an ascending order: first love bears all things, and then love believes all things. Instead of suspecting the worst, instead of giving up, instead of denouncing the offender, love believes in the best in someone else. Love sees the wrong, love sees the weakness, it throws a mantle of silence over the weakness, it suppresses the sin, and then it believes the best. Love isn&rsquo;t cynical nor suspicious of everybody and everything. Love wouldn&rsquo;t presume that a person is evil and won&rsquo;t be trying to find it. Even when seeing a person do wrong, love won&rsquo;t think &ldquo;Oh, I knew it!&rdquo;. Love won&rsquo;t think that a person is hopeless and will never change. Love always believes the best. And love believes that the person will change for the better.<br>So when somebody goes wrong and you say, &ldquo;Ah, they revealed their true character,&rdquo; it proves you don&rsquo;t love them, because love doesn&rsquo;t let go like that. You start hating somebody and you&rsquo;ll start finding faults; but you start loving somebody and you&rsquo;ll start covering. <br>That&rsquo;s the difference: love is a harbor of trust for those who are doubted by everybody else. So love believes. [And loves tries to see that &ldquo;best&rdquo;, find it, encourage it, and help it grow.]<br>(MacArthur)</span></p><p class="c2"><span>13:7: </span><span class="c0">Love hopes all things</span><span class="c4">.<br>(MacArthur)</span></p><p class="c2"><span>13:7: </span><span class="c0">Love endures all things</span><span class="c4">.<br>(MacArthur)</span></p><p class="c2"><span>16:14: Paul has just given four military commands; here&rsquo;s a fifth: </span><span class="c0">be loving</span><span>. This is such an important one because it balances everything else off. Let all your things be done in love. That&rsquo;s the beautiful softening principle.<br>What Paul leads us to is unretreating courage and unfailing </span><span class="c0">love</span><span class="c4">. And they have to come side by side. Too much love and not enough standing, and you&rsquo;re going to wash away in sentimentalism. Too much standing and not enough love, and you&rsquo;re going to be sort of an ugly theologian. Got to be both. Got to have love and sound doctrine. We see these things again and again through the New Testament. They&rsquo;ve got to go together. Let everything you do be done in love. And by love we simply mean self-sacrificing service to the one in need, that&rsquo;s all. Self-sacrificing service to the one in need. Not emotion. Not a feeling, but an act of love, an act of service. Jesus said, &ldquo;Love one another as I have loved you.&rdquo; The way he just loved them was to wash their feet and that&rsquo;s how we love, by washing feet. That is meeting the need of a person who has a need.<br>We&rsquo;ve got two things he says then, &ldquo;You want to straighten your church out? Sound doctrine and love.&rdquo; &nbsp;<br>(MacArthur)</span></p><p class="c2 c10"><span class="c4"></span></p><h2 class="c14" id="h.4fitrav5u2di"><span class="c5 c0">2 Corinthians</span></h2><p class="c2"><span class="c4">9:8: Nowhere is it more magnificently summarized than in this very epistle, 2 Corinthians. Go back to chapter 9 for a moment and verse 8. This is the greatest statement on the sufficiency of grace made anywhere in the Scripture. Notice its comprehensiveness. Second Corinthians 9:8, &ldquo;And God is able&rdquo; &ndash; that is he is powerful enough; he is capable &ndash; &ldquo;to make all grace abound to you, that always having all sufficiency in everything, you may have an abundance for every good deed.&rdquo;<br>The superlatives here are almost overwhelming: all grace, all sufficiency, in all things, all ways, and an abundance for all or every good deed. God has the ability to pour out enough grace so that it literally overflows you and always you will have all sufficiency for all the issues of life and an abundance of grace for every good deed. You have all the grace available you need to believe. You have all the grace you need to remove your sin and apply the righteousness of Christ to you. You have all the necessary grace to understand the Word. You have all the necessary grace granted to you to apply the Word, to overcome temptation, to triumph over habitual sin. You have all the grace necessary to endure suffering and disappointment and pain and sorrow. You have all the grace necessary to obey the Lord, all the grace required to serve Him effectively and powerfully, all the grace necessary to worship Him in truth and in spirit.<br>(MacArthur)</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c4">9:8: Some would suggest that when you get to the deep things, you have to turn away from the Scripture, because the Scripture&rsquo;s only good for the light touch. If you want the deep things to be dealt with, you&rsquo;ve got to turn to psychology and psychiatry and therapy and counseling and even medication. You have to fill in the lack in our Christian life with some human insight or human wisdom. Sad to say, as bizarre as that sounds, most churches have bought into that.<br>Most evangelical churches have bought into the idea that the serious problems that Christians have are beyond the realm of the spiritual; they&rsquo;re beyond the realm of the power of God. They&rsquo;re beyond grace; they&rsquo;re beyond divine grace, and they require human technique &ndash; human technique, for the large part, invented and defined and basically altered over the last 120 years. Psychology is offered as the source of power in solving the deep problems while divine grace is adequate only for the shallower ones. You have to turn to some human source for the deep things, and you can turn to God for the shallow ones.<br>Now, that may be the worst of it. On the other hand, the best of it might be churches that believe only shallow things can be dealt with by divine grace, deep things need human wisdom. How strange is that?<br>Is the Word of God so insufficient? Which Word is perfect, totally transforming the whole person, according to Psalm 19. Is the wisdom from above which confounds all the wisdom of man and calls it foolishness so insufficient to call upon that foolishness to help it? Is the Lord Jesus Christ, in whom we are complete, in whom we have all things that pertain to life and godliness and have become partakers of His own divine nature and possessors of all his fullness, so insufficient that He can&rsquo;t provide what we need? Is the Holy Spirit who has filled us with might in the inner man and given us all the fullness of God so we can do exceeding abundantly above all we can ask or think so weak and insufficient as not to be able to help us cope? It&rsquo;s unthinkable. Is the package of spiritual resources we have received in salvation, which enables us to do everything in which we are strengthened unto all things in Christ, unable at any point in our lives?<br>And what does human wisdom add to us? When Paul said, &ldquo;our sufficiency is from God,&rdquo; was that just ignorance? Was he wrong? Was that foolishness?<br>What a tragic delusion in the world, but what an infinitely more tragic delusion in the church.<br>(MacArthur)</span></p><p class="c2"><span>12:7: &ldquo;</span><span class="c0">There was given me</span><span class="c4">&rdquo; &ndash; and I told you it was given to him by God. And I remind you that most people want to wander through life thinking that God brings all the good times, and the Devil brings all the bad times and don&rsquo;t understand that the bad times come at the will of God just like the good times. And the bad times are by God&rsquo;s design and far more productive than the good times. (MacArthur)</span></p><p class="c2"><span>12:7: Literally the word &ldquo;</span><span class="c0">thorn</span><span>&rdquo; is a stake. He was impaled by this thing; it was just rammed through him, impaling him. And what was it? He defines this thorn in his flesh &ldquo;a </span><span class="c0">messenger of satan</span><span class="c4">.&rdquo; That&rsquo;s another word for a demon, an aggelos of satan, satan&rsquo;s angel, a demon. (MacArthur)</span></p><p class="c2"><span>12:7: The word &ldquo;</span><span class="c0">buffet</span><span>&rdquo; meaning to punch. This thing was hammering on me. And God had brought this. (MacArthur)</span></p><p class="c2"><span>12:7: Paul had not only had a trip to heaven, but he had a revelation of Christ on the Damascus Road, and he had a further revelation of Christ when He came to him when he was in jail in the land of Israel. He had a further revelation that God gave him when an angel joined him on a ship. The Holy Spirit came to him and testified to him about chains and imprisonment. I mean there was just this constant flow. We&rsquo;re not talking about the 13 epistles that he received by inspiration; we&rsquo;re talking about direct contact with heaven. And that&rsquo;s enough to make the best of men </span><span class="c0">proud</span><span class="c4">. It&rsquo;s a little intimidating. And you can imagine there&rsquo;s a little dialogue about missionary strategy. And Silas is there, and maybe Timothy&rsquo;s there. And there&#39;s a disagreement. And Paul might say: &ldquo;How many times have you fellows been to heaven? None, good. We&rsquo;ll do my plan.&rdquo; I mean, you know, just the humblest of men would be exalted with that kind of experience. (MacArthur)</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c4">12:7: Let me tell you something, folks, God blesses us. But while you&rsquo;re in there praying for blessing and blessing and blessing and blessing, you&rsquo;d better realize that the more you&rsquo;re blessed, the more likely you are to need to be &ndash; what? &ndash; humbled. So, the backside of all this blessing you may be pleading for may be painful. So, God uses suffering to humble us. And listen, folks, if need be, he&rsquo;ll use Satan to do it. But as I look at my own life and I see God&rsquo;s blessing on my life, I just always walk in anticipation of a disaster. And I do? I&rsquo;m never surprised. I&rsquo;m &ndash; you know what? I&rsquo;m almost relieved when it happens, because then it&rsquo;ll get over. You know, the Lord blesses and blesses, and he blesses the teaching of the Word, and he blesses the Church, and he blesses the ministry. And you know that somewhere down the road your flesh is going to say, &ldquo;Look at all the success, look at all this blessing.&rdquo; And the Lord is going to have to send a messenger from Satan to drive a stake through your otherwise proud flesh. Right? So, you expect, and it comes, and it&rsquo;s necessary.Trouble does reveal our spiritual character, and trouble does humble us. When the best and most beloved of our accomplishments start to fall apart, and we can&rsquo;t do anything about it, that&rsquo;s very humbling, and it&rsquo;s painful, but it&rsquo;s purposeful. (MacArthur)</span></p><p class="c2"><span>12:7: It&rsquo;s notable he didn&rsquo;t start messing with the demon. He didn&rsquo;t </span><span class="c3">bind</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;Satan, or try to cast that demon out, in the name of Christ. He just went to God. Directly to God who controls men and demons. (MacArthur)</span></p><p class="c2"><span>12:9: </span><span class="c0">grace</span><span>&nbsp;is a magnificent Greek word used 155 times in the New Testament. Now, the word in the Greek is </span><span class="c3">charis</span><span>, and it basically means a favor bestowed. It means a generous gift given. That is its sort of normal, common meaning. But in the sense of the New Testament, in its redemptive sense, it means a favor bestowed and a generous given &ndash; a generous gift given by God to people who are totally undeserving and unworthy. It is God&rsquo;s favor, God&rsquo;s goodness, God&rsquo;s generosity to provide for those who are unworthy of that provision. It starts at salvation, and it goes right on forever, because it tells us in Ephesians that through the ages to come, God will show the riches of His kindness in his grace toward us. <br>This grace is a dynamic force. It is a dynamic force by which God applies to us everything we need to save us, to keep us, to enable us, to deliver us, to sanctify us, to glorify us. We were saved by grace, Ephesians 2 says, through faith, but it is God&rsquo;s grace that just initiates their sustains all the way through all of eternity. Every benefit in life, every benefit in eternity is by God&rsquo;s grace.<br>And this great redemptive aspect of grace comes only to those who know Jesus Christ. It is faith in Jesus Christ that brings us into God&rsquo;s &quot;uncommon&quot; grace, into God&rsquo;s special saving grace and eternal grace.<br>No word more clearly sums up the message of our faith in grace, and no word sets us apart from all other religions of the world than grace, for all others have inherently in them some attainment of salvation through some human achievement, religious or moral, or a combination of both.<br>But ours is a grace religion. Ours is a faith that includes the concept &ndash; the overriding concept that we deserve nothing, and yet God gives us everything. Because of his goodness, he bestows on us eternally favors undeserved.<br>See also: note on 2 Cor 9:8.<br>(MacArthur)</span></p><h2 class="c14" id="h.pgnv3qxqydy"><span class="c5 c0">Galatians</span></h2><p class="c2"><span>2:12: Peter </span><span class="c0">separated himself</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;likely because he has previously had issues with the Jews: in Acts 11:3, they criticised Peter for his eating with the Gentiles. He tried to avoid problems; issues, he stood accused of hypocrisy.</span></p><h2 class="c14" id="h.kzutmx6mcj5g"><span class="c5 c0">Ephesians</span></h2><p class="c2"><span>1:7: &ldquo;</span><span class="c0">In Him we have redemption through His blood</span><span>.&rdquo; &nbsp;He redeemed us. &nbsp;What does it mean to redeem? &nbsp;To buy back. &nbsp;What did He do to buy us? &nbsp;Well, we were slaves to sin. &nbsp;We were slaves to death, and hell, and Satan, and demons. &nbsp;We were slave to the fallen flesh. &nbsp;We were slave to the world. &nbsp;And there we were in the slave market. &nbsp;And He came to the slave market and He bought us. &nbsp;Worthless, wretched, vile, rotten, darkened, hopeless, with minds that could never know God, and hearts that could never seek righteousness, and all our desire was lust and evil, and we were unworthy, and He came and bought us. &nbsp;Why? &nbsp;Because He chose us. &nbsp;Because He predestined us. &nbsp;Because He was wanting to grace us with grace. &nbsp;You say, &ldquo;Why did He want to do that?&rdquo; &nbsp;I don&rsquo;t know. &nbsp;He just did. &nbsp;That was His will, that was His purpose, that was His good pleasure.<br></span><span class="c0">Forgiveness</span><span class="c4">, aphimi, to send away never to return. &nbsp;He removed our sins as far as the East is from the West. &nbsp;He buried them in the depths of the sea. &nbsp;He remembers them no more. &nbsp;No wonder Micah says, &ldquo;Who is a pardoning God like You?&rdquo; &nbsp;Paul says, &ldquo;There is therefore now no condemnation to those who are in Christ.&rdquo; &nbsp;Ephesians 4:32, Colossians 2:13 says, &ldquo;We are forgiven.&rdquo; &nbsp;First John 2:12, &ldquo;My little children, He has forgiven all your sins for His namesake.&rdquo; &nbsp;How could He do that? &nbsp;Through His grace, through the riches of His grace, which He lavished on us. &nbsp;It took a lot of grace, a lot of grace because we had a lot of sin. &nbsp;In fact, according to the parable of Matthew 18, we have an unpayable debt, almost an uncountable debt, an indescribable debt. &nbsp;To whom do you owe your salvation? &nbsp;You owe it to the God who chose you. &nbsp;You owe it to the God who predestined you. &nbsp;You owe it to the God who redeemed you, the God who forgave you, the God who wanted you to be His own. &nbsp;Because He wanted you to be His own; it doesn&rsquo;t give any other reason, even though we&rsquo;re so unworthy. &nbsp;So unworthy. (MacArthur)</span></p><p class="c2"><span>1:13: Notice, </span><span class="c0">He sealed us</span><span class="c4">. Verse 13, &ldquo;In Him you also after listening to the message of the truth, the gospel of your salvation having also believed, you were sealed in Him with the Holy Spirit of promise who is given as a pledge or a guarantee of our inheritance, with a view looking forward to the redemption of God&rsquo;s own possession,&rdquo; that&rsquo;s us, &ldquo;to the praise of His glory.&rdquo; &nbsp;He sealed us. &nbsp;Sealing something in ancient times was a sign of ownership, a sign of security, a sign of authenticity and a sign of a completed transaction. &nbsp;When we were saved, He sealed us. &nbsp;How? &nbsp;Gave us His Spirit. &nbsp;The Holy Spirit dwelling in a believer is a sign that God owns that believer, a sign that that believer is secure, a sign that that believer is authentic, a sign that that believer has received the completed transaction. &nbsp;He secures us, authenticates us, completes us, and owns us, we are His own possession. &nbsp;Verse 14 says: and the indwelling Spirit is the guarantee that someday we&rsquo;ll experience the fullness of what that means. &nbsp;Marvelous. &nbsp;We wait for the full redemption, Romans 8 says, but we&rsquo;re sealed until that day. (MacArthur)</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c4">5:22: The prerequisites start in v. 19: have a joyful spirit; v. 20: be thankful, even for the trials (because they come from God and have a perfecting work); v.21: have an attitude of mutual submission, in which you consider others better than yourselves. These are the spiritual prerequisites for a successful marriage. (MacArthur)</span></p><p class="c2"><span>5:22: Sarah called her husband &quot;</span><span class="c0">Lord</span><span class="c4">&quot; (1 Pet 3:6). (MacArthur)</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c4">5:23: It is the leadership of care, in a context of love. (MacArthur)</span></p><p class="c2"><span>5:25: It is the </span><span class="c0">love</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;of self-sacrifice, not the love of domination (MacArthur)</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c4">5:25: It was revolutionary in a society where males had control over the female population, which were considered less than human, with no rights at all. Paul says you have to exchange that for a self-sacrificing, humble, unselfish love. (MacArthur).</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c4">5:25: It is a command from the Lord to love your wife. You can&#39;t say &quot;I don&#39;t love her anymore&quot; without admitting that you have sinned. Christ loved sinners when they hated Him, that&#39;s the standard. (MacArthur)</span></p><p class="c2"><span>5:25: A husband should love his wife not for what she can do for him, but for what he can do for her. Like </span><span class="c0">Christ</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;loved the church, not for anything we could do or were. Swallow your personal desires, put everything aside &mdash; because that boils down to temptation. Sacrifice yourself, living a spirit-led life. (MacArthur)</span></p><p class="c2"><span>5:26: If you really </span><span class="c0">love</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;your wife, you got to hate everything that defiles her. Anything that steals her purity will become to you a terrifying enemy. Any so-called love the drags the partner down to uncleanness is a false love. You are to live your wife in such a way that you look toward her godliness. Love always seeks the absolute purity of its subject. And seeks it&#39;s sacrificially. It may mean confrontation, it may mean a certain discipline, but it&#39;s certainly means you protect her from temptation and that you expose her to the purifying influence of God&#39;s truth. (Jn 17:17: &quot;Sanctify them by the truth; your word is truth&quot;). (MacArthur)</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c4">5:25-27: This love is a sacrificial love (v. 25), a cleansing love (v. 27), a caring love (v. 28).</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c4">5:28: The essence is meeting needs, being concerned to fulfill each requirement with great devotion. We are called to treat our wives with the same preoccupation we give to ourselves. If she has a need, or a secret longing, a reasonable dream, we are to look to fulfil it. We are to nourish her, so that she, in her marvellous role, can nourish the children. (MacArthur)</span></p><p class="c2"><span>5:29: &quot;</span><span class="c0">to nourish</span><span class="c4">&quot; literally means &quot;to warm with body heat&quot;, like a mother bird warms her children. (MacArthur)</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c4">5:31: After you&#39;ve married, you became one body &nbsp;Therefore, if you want to be a happy husband, you have a happy wife. If you want to be a fulfilled husband, you&#39;ll have a fulfilled wife. You want a real happiness in your marriage, then treat her as you treat yourself. (MacArthur)</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c4">5:31: This is such a union that is a oneness of the flesh. This physical union goes beyond that, but it starts with a physical relationship. You become one person, co-mingled with your life partner. (MacArthur)</span></p><p class="c2"><span>5:31: An advice for the young people: pick carefully, it&#39;s for life! What&#39;s the key to picking wisely? Simple. Be filled with the Spirit, walking in a godly way, so that your mind is tuned to the will of God. That&#39;s why when young couples come in for counselling before getting married, the first thing we ask them is: are you involved with each other physically? Because if they are, they&#39;re in a sinful condition, and people in a sinful condition cannot discern the will of God! So you have to separate and live a godly life to be able to understand the mind of the Spirit, then you&#39;ll know! I always tell the young people: don&#39;t worry about finding the right person, worry about </span><span class="c3">being</span><span>&nbsp;the right person! And if you are the right person, then the person God has for you will recognize you.</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;Now, what would you look for? First, find out someone&#39;s reputation. (Pr 22:1: &quot;a good name is better than riches&quot;). Second, try to avoid a reclamation project and wait until the spirit of God has done that. The idea of marriage is not so that you can lead her to Christ. Thirdly. &quot;Favor is deceitful, beauty is vain, but a woman who fears the Lord, she should be praised&quot;. Find someone who worships the Lord from the heart. Look for reputation, look for a worshipping heart. Listen to what they say, because &quot;out of the abundance of the heart the mouth speaks&quot;. What&#39;s the conversation like? What kind of people do they run with? Shallow people, deep people, godly people? (1 Cor 15:33: &quot;evil company corrupts good morals&quot;). And check out their wardrobe! Really? Absolutely! Because &quot;godly women are not so much concerned with the adornment of the body as they are with the inward adornment&quot;. And when they do call attention to themselves, they call attention to their virtue. (MacArthur)</span></p><p class="c2"><span>5:32: Like </span><span class="c0">Christ</span><span>&nbsp;loves the </span><span class="c0">church</span><span class="c4">? That&#39;s an unbreakable love that just keeps forgiving and never becomes embittered. Can man cast off his wife? I&#39;ll answer that question with a question: can Christ cast off His church? (MacArthur)</span></p><p class="c2"><span>5:33: What is it, most importantly, that causes relationships to be sustained over a long haul? In a word, it is forgiveness. No matter who you&#39;re married to, they&#39;re going to fail you. They&#39;re going to offend you. They&#39;re going to misunderstand you. They&#39;re going to misinterpret what you mean by what you do. You are going to offend them. You are going to sin against them. You are going to disappoint them. This is true in any kind of relationship -- because we are sinful creatures, we are fallen creatures. In you marriage you are headed to major disaster if you continually accumulate hostility because of offenses, if you continually allow this bitterness to develop. But whenever there is an immediate forgiveness, it&#39;s disappearing, it&#39;s gone. That&#39;s the key to any relationship. And what essentially keeps that from destroying relationships is fogiveness. <br>In fact, in Prov 19:11 it says &quot;it is man&#39;s glory to overlook a transgression&quot;. Never is a man more lofty or more noble than when he forgives. Our society sees that as weakness, but unforgiveness is a very severe thing: it imprisons people in the past, produces deep bitterness, distort how you see life. But </span><span class="c3">forgiveness is the most godlike act that a person can do</span><span class="c4">! No act is more like God than forgiveness, never are you more like Him than when you forgive someone who has offended you! It is a promise of undeserved, unearned love that affirms to the offender that there is no hatred, no anger, no desire for vengeance, no retaliation, because guilt and blame has been removed, there is no self-pity and there is no bitterness. <br>And that is precisely the attitude of God towards sinners that He grants to us in Scripture. &quot;Forgive each other, just as God in Christ forgiven you; be imitators of God&quot;. Eph 4:32-5:1. Also Col 3:13. Moreover, if we don&#39;t forgive, God will not forgive us (Mt 6:15) and will &quot;turn us over to tormentors&quot; (Mt 18:34-35). It is chastening, serious chastening, torturers, tormentors! Might be stress, hardship, illness, difficulty. James 2:13 says the same thing: &quot;judgment will be merciless to the one that shows no mercy&quot;.

In v. 16, however, Paul says &ldquo;</span><span class="c0">take up</span><span>&rdquo;, means that this is something that you only use when necessary, when the flaming arrows start to fly, and you </span><span class="c0">take it up </span><span>in addition to what you already have. <br></span><span class="c0">The shield of faith</span><span>, whatever it is, is sufficient first of all because with it you can </span><span class="c0">extinguish</span><span>&nbsp;not some, but </span><span class="c0">all</span><span>&nbsp;of </span><span class="c0">the fiery arrows</span><span class="c4">. What are those fiery darts? Those were arrows whose heads were soaked in pitch, which would burn rather slowly but rather hotly. Paul is simply referring to templations: the devil is literally bombards the believer with the arrows, the fiery darts of seductive temptation, to elicit out of us ungodly, non-Christlike, evil responses. And the only defense, Paul says, is the shield of faith. (MacArthur)</span></p><p class="c2"><span>6:13: The important thing in Christian life is not to chase the devil, not to bind him, control him, or expel him, but simply to </span><span class="c0">stand</span><span class="c4">. Stand where we are and not budge. Stand. (~MacArthur)</span></p><p class="c2"><span>6:14: Four times Paul says that the most important duty of a Christian is to </span><span class="c0">stand</span><span>. Before doing anything else, simply </span><span class="c0">stand</span><span>&nbsp;on what you&#39;ve learned, and </span><span class="c0">withstand </span><span>every attempt of the enemy to move you. Do not budge or move; </span><span class="c0">stand</span><span class="c4">! (MacArthur)</span></p><p class="c2"><span>6:15: The </span><span class="c0">shoes </span><span>were not a fashion item, but the means to protect your feet. The best warrior out there with the best armor would be absolutely immobilized and debilitated if he hurts his feet. Roman soldiers had leather shoes with thick soles so that they could firmly stand on any surface, rocky or flat, slippery or not, and this firm foundation let the soldier fight a good fight without stumbling or slipping. <br>Here Paul says that this thick and firm foundation is the </span><span class="c0">Gospel</span><span class="c4">: the very thing that every Christian stands on and the thing that guarantees his stability. The gospel lets the Christian stand firm. (MacArthur)</span></p><p class="c2"><span>6:15: Many interpreters hold that this verse is speaking about preaching the </span><span class="c0">gospel</span><span>, but this is not what Paul speak about here. The </span><span class="c0">gospel</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;gives firmness of footing to give solid ground in the battle, but this firmness is not for going, but for standing! This verse does not speak about going around and preaching the gospel; it speaks about standing firm and fighting the devil! Paul makes it clear in vv. 13 and 14. Because of the gospel we don&rsquo;t slip, we don&rsquo;t slide, we don&rsquo;t fall when under attack. (MacArthur)</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c4">6:15: The solution to confronting satan is the word of God. What shatters satan&#39;s power, what unmasks him and devastates him is the word of God. And we see that modeled in the temptations of Jesus, where Satan comes to Him with three temptations, and every single time Jesus quotes scripture to him and vanquishes him by quoting scripture in the face of that confrontation. (MacArthur)</span></p><p class="c2"><span>6:15: This </span><span class="c0">peace</span><span>&nbsp;that Paul talks about is the peace that has reconciled the fallen and sinful man to the holy God by the means of the gospel: the sacrifice of His Son. The gospel is in that man was at war with God, but God made </span><span class="c0">peace</span><span>. And this peace gives </span><span class="c0">readiness</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;&mdash; literally meaning. being equipped, having foundation and firm footing &mdash; because when I know I am at peace with God, when I know that God is on my side, I can have the devil throw at me whatever he wants, and I can be confident that I will stand firm. Because God is on my side. (MacArthur)</span></p><p class="c2"><span>6:17: </span><span class="c0">The helmet of salvation</span><span class="c4">. The helmet of salvation serves the purpose of deflecting blows from heavy swords all the enemy. Sin no longer has dominion over you, that&#39;s what salvation means. <br>A believer has been saved once, and he&#39;s being continually cleansed from all unrighteousness: in the past, we have been saved from the penalty of sin; in the present, we are being saved from the power of sin; and in the future, we will be saved from the presence of sim. Salvation has happened, is happening, and will happen. Justification, sanctification, glorification.

The Word of God, the general idea. It is the word </span><span class="c3">rh&#275;ma</span><span>&nbsp;(an utterance, by implication, a matter or topic), and it means a specific statement. It isn&rsquo;t talking about a broad knowledge. It&rsquo;s talking about a specific statement. </span><span class="c0">The sword of the Spirit</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;is the specific statement of God. A specific teaching, a specific utterance, which applies to a specific situation you&rsquo;re facing.<br>And if you don&rsquo;t know what God specifically says about that temptation, you can&rsquo;t deal with it. &nbsp;So that you must learn to know the total of the Word of God so that you know the specifics. &nbsp;That&rsquo;s why when I teach you the Bible I don&rsquo;t just read you the Scripture, tell three stories, and send you away. &nbsp;What I try to do is teach you the principles in the text. &nbsp;Because the principle is the specific statement that God wants you to understand so you can put it in your reservoir to use against Satan.

Barker was a master of illustrations. &nbsp;One day he described himself looking out a window and watching a garden full of plants and flowers. &nbsp;And he said, &ldquo;I saw three things&rdquo; in the garden. &nbsp;&ldquo;First, I saw a butterfly. &nbsp;The butterfly was beautiful, and it would alight on a flower and then it would flutter to another flower and then it would flutter to another flower. &nbsp;Only for a second or two would it sit and it would move on and it would touch as many lovely blossoms as it could, but derived absolutely no benefit from it. &nbsp;Then&rdquo; &ndash; he said &ndash; &ldquo;I watched a little longer out my window and there came a botanist. &nbsp;And the botanist had a big notebook under his arm and a great big magnifying glass. &nbsp;The botanist would lean over a certain flower and he would look for a long time and then he would write notes in his notebook. &nbsp;He was there for hours writing notes, closed them, stuck them under his arm, tucked his magnifying glass in his pocket, walked away.&rdquo; &nbsp;And then he said, &ldquo;The third thing I noticed was a bee, just a little bee. &nbsp;But the bee would light on a flower and it would sink down deep into the flower and it would extract all the pollen that it could carry. &nbsp;It went in empty every time and came out full. <br>And H. P. Barker said, &ldquo;So it is with people who approach the Bible. &nbsp;There are those who just flutter from lovely sermon to lovely sermon, from class to class, fluttering here, fluttering there, bringing nothing, and gaining nothing. &nbsp;What a nice feeling. &nbsp;Then there are the spiritual botanists who take copious notes who are trying to make sure that all the vowel pointings are correct but they don&rsquo;t have the capacity to draw anything out of the flowers; it&#39;s pure academics. &nbsp;Then there are the spiritual bees who draw out of every precious flower all that is there to make the honey that makes them so blessed to those around them.&rdquo; &nbsp;Which are you? &nbsp;You can come to Grace Church and be a butterfly. &nbsp;You can flit from class to class, Bible study to Bible study, seminar to seminar, book to book, flipping your little pretty wings, never changing. &nbsp;Or you can be a botanist. &nbsp;Some of you have enough notebooks to sink a small battleship. &nbsp;Or you can be a bee coming in empty and going out full and turning it into the honey that makes life sweet. &nbsp;Which are you? &nbsp;The sword is there, it&rsquo;s available. &nbsp;Are you using it?<br>(MacArthur)</span></p><h2 class="c14" id="h.z1gj677mhewz"><span class="c5 c0">Philippians</span></h2><p class="c2"><span>2:7: Jesus trusted His Father.

Everything is potentially a temptation, and a test. I&#39;ve always looked at it this way. If you&#39;ve rejected a temptation then it&#39;s a test. If you&#39;ve succumbed to a temptation, it is then a temptation to which you fell. <br>If you&#39;re going through a difficulty and you get angry at God, this is a temptation to which you&#39;ve fell; on the other hand, if you stay strong and realize that the thing you&#39;re going through is a test to make you strong, that God is putting you through something that&#39;s going to be a blessing to you &mdash; if you realize that, then it was a test that you passed. The outcome is what determines what it was. So it&#39;s basically the same thing. <br>I think you can&#39;t go through life trying to figure out whether something is good or evil in itself: just about anything that comes your way could be good or evil depending on how you react to it. The worst possible suffering might come into your life and tempt you to curse God might be a test that will prove the faithfulness and solidarity of your faith. Everything has the potential of being a temptation or a test &mdash; depending on how the believer responds to it. <br>(MacArthur)</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c4">1:2: MacArthur; &ldquo;How God Uses Suffering&rdquo;<br>Now, the question is what does God accomplish in the life of His own through suffering? Why did God allow this? We would assume today that if that ever happens, that&rsquo;s the devil; that&rsquo;s satan; that&rsquo;s demons operating on their own and against the will of God. But not in this case and not always. God is allowing this to happen. Why? And I&rsquo;m going to give you five reasons why God allows suffering in your life and mine. Five reasons. And they are formidable, practical, powerful reasons. And I really believe they will become an anchor for your soul in trouble.<br>Number one, God uses suffering to reveal our spiritual condition. God uses suffering to reveal our spiritual character. You really do not know the truth about someone spiritually when everything is going well. Right? It doesn&rsquo;t surface, because, basically, they appear to be at peace, and happy, and with a measure of joy and satisfaction and fulfillment in life because superficially and on the surface everything&rsquo;s okay. <br>Then when things begin to go wrong, reality begins to surface as to their spiritual condition. And the worse things get, the more their spiritual character is unbared. When you strip away the blessings, and you strip away the successes, and you strip away the prosperity, and you strip away the health, and you begin to peel it all back, then you&rsquo;re going to find out what somebody is really made of spiritually. <br>When you go through the sufferings of life, God has a purpose. His purpose is to manifest the character of your spiritual life to everybody around you, and to you as well. His purpose is to humble you because of his multitude of blessings poured out upon you, and his purpose is to draw you into the intimacy of his glorious presence. <br>Number two, God uses suffering to humble us. God uses suffering to humble us. And listen, folks, if need be, he&rsquo;ll use Satan to do it.<br>Number three. God uses suffering to draw us to himself. God uses suffering to draw us to himself. Look what Paul did when he was sent &quot;a thorn in the flesh, a messenger from satan&quot; (2 Cor 12:7). Where did he go? To the Lord. Don&rsquo;t you think that might have been the purpose &ndash; or one of the purposes? That&rsquo;s the right response. He didn&rsquo;t go to Timothy or Titus; he didn&rsquo;t go to some of his buddies; he didn&rsquo;t go to his friends; he didn&rsquo;t go to somebody with an earthly formula; he didn&rsquo;t find a therapy to fix his pain. He didn&rsquo;t look for a technique; he wasn&rsquo;t after human wisdom. He went to the Lord. <br>You know, I think this is the &ndash; this is the very special thing that happens in suffering. He was immediately forced into the presence of God, and that&rsquo;s the best place you could ever be, isn&rsquo;t it? <br>And have you noticed how good times don&rsquo;t do that? And the severer the trouble, the more likely you are to have an increase in your prayer life. Is that not true? When they take your little baby into the hospital, and they tell you it could die, you get real serious about your prayer life. When you find out your teenager&rsquo;s on drugs, you get real serious about your prayer life. When you find out your life partner has cancer, you get real serious about our prayers. When you find out you&rsquo;re on the brink of your business going down the proverbial drain, and everything you&rsquo;ve put into it, your life savings is potentially to be lost, your prayer life takes another level. Well, I think sometimes that&rsquo;s what God has in mind.<br>Point number four, God uses suffering to display His grace. Remember what God said to Paul pleading to remove the thorn that was torturing him? Paul went three times, and three times he got the same answer. &ldquo;Paul, I hear you. I know you&rsquo;re asking for the thorn to be removed. I know you&rsquo;re asking for the messenger of Satan to be removed. I understand all of that. I&rsquo;m sorry, however; I&rsquo;m not going to do that. I&rsquo;m just going to turn up the grace.&rdquo; Standing answer.<br>God answers not by removing the pain, because the pain was productive; not by removing the trouble, because the trouble was productive. It really showed the true man, and it humbled him, and it drew him to God. And so, God says, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not going to remove that; the process isn&rsquo;t over. But what I am going to do is increase the grace so that you can endure it.&rdquo; He gave relief. God gave relief not by removal, but by sufficient strength to persevere through the necessary humbling process.<br>In 1 Timothy 1:14, Paul says, &ldquo;The grace of our Lord was more than abundant.&rdquo; Wow, more than abundant. Now, folks, get this, would you please? Here is the cornerstone of Christian living. Here is the cornerstone of Christian living; it is simply this &ndash; listen carefully &ndash; you will have trouble. In this life, it is inevitable, and it is useful because it produces the evidence of your true spiritual condition, humility, and intimacy with God, and allows God to put Himself on display in His grace. This is the cornerstone of Christian living, folks: you will have trouble. God does not promise to remove it, but he does promise to pour out enough grace to endure it.<br>See, that is the &ndash; that&rsquo;s the current contemporary lie, that God wants your life to be happy and peaceful and comfortable and successful and satisfactory and prosperous. And it&rsquo;s the Devil who wants all the bad stuff.<br>You want to know the truth? It&rsquo;s the Devil who would like to make your life prosperous and successful and happy and tranquil, because then you wouldn&rsquo;t need God, and you wouldn&rsquo;t need have to thank Him for anything.<br>The prosperity message is the Devil&rsquo;s message. God&rsquo;s message is a message of suffering and grace. God wants us humble, and He uses suffering to humble us. God wants us intimate with Him, and He uses suffering to make us intimate with Him. And God wants our testimony made manifest; He wants our character on display, and He uses suffering to reveal it. And the greatest testimonies the Christian ever have in history is when they&rsquo;re persecuted. And the persecution of the saints, the blood of the martyrs becomes a seed of the Church. God will crank up the grace in your life, and He&rsquo;ll crank up enough grace for you to be able to endure.<br>And you&rsquo;ll find yourself singing at the strangest places and times. And you&rsquo;ll find a peace in your hear that knows no explanation, and you&rsquo;ll find a joy that&rsquo;s disconnected from your circumstances because this grace is an energy that transforms. It&rsquo;s not in itself a static gift. Grace is an energy that changes you. It&rsquo;s an energy of being flooded with blessing from God that altars your thinking. It changes you, transforms you.<br>Yes, Paul was in his deepest suffering, but God was using it to put His grace on display. And that turns you into a worshipper, doesn&rsquo;t it? And God wants you to worship Him. And you couldn&rsquo;t fully worship Him, you wouldn&rsquo;t know the abandonment of joy and the abandonment of heart that Paul and Silas knew in the jail, unless you had sufficient grace in the midst of dire suffering. The people who worship God most deeply are those who have been through the deepest water and who have been flooded by His grace.<br>One last point, God uses suffering to perfect His power. God uses suffering to perfect His power. God wanted Paul not just to be a humble man, not just to be a man of prayer and intimacy with God. Paul was not only to be a man of suffering so that God could display His grace, but God wanted this man to be powerful. God wanted this man to be used to change the world. God wanted him to impact individuals, and families, and cities, and nations.<br>You see, when the Christian gets to the place where he&rsquo;s lost all human ability to deal with his difficulty, he&rsquo;s got nowhere to go. Nowhere to go when you realize you&rsquo;re weak, when you realize you can&rsquo;t fix it. You see, when your &ndash; when your human wisdom&rsquo;s out, when our human confidence is out, when your human ingenuity is out, when your solutions to the problems are out, when you have nowhere to go and nowhere to turn but God, you are now in a position to be most effective. I&rsquo;ll put it this way, no one in the kingdom of God is too weak to be powerful, but many are too strong. Many are too strong. You see, physical suffering, mental anguish, disappointment, unfulfillment, failure creates a pressure that produces power. It really does, because it just squeezes everything out of us so that we become nothing but a clear channel through which the power of God can flow.<br>So, when we have the deepest troubles in life, and we go through these things we go through those of unfulfilled relationships and brokenheartedness and unsatisfied desires, and we suffer from those who should love us the most, remember, God is at work. The world can&rsquo;t fix it and probably shouldn&rsquo;t, because God is using it to reveal your spiritual character, to humble you, to draw you to Himself, to put His grace on display, and to make you powerful.<br>A few years ago, a song was written that really says it. I&rsquo;ll close with this. It&rsquo;s called &ldquo;The Refiner&rsquo;s Fire.&rdquo; Listen carefully to the words. &ldquo;There burns a fire with sacred heat/White hot with holy flame/And all who dare pass through its blaze/Will not emerge the same/Some as bronze, and some as silver/Some as gold, then with great skill/All are hammered by their sufferings/On the anvil of His will/I&rsquo;m learning now to trust His touch/To crave the fire&rsquo;s embrace/For though my past with sin was etched/His mercies did erase/Each time His purging cleanses deeper/I&rsquo;m not sure that I&rsquo;ll survive/Yet the strength in growing weaker/Keeps my hungry spirit alive.&rdquo;<br>And then this great chorus, &ldquo;The Refiner&rsquo;s fire/Has now become my soul desire/Purged and cleansed and purified/That the Lord be glorified/He is consuming my soul/Refining me, making me whole/No matter what I lose/I choose the Refiner&rsquo;s fire.&quot;<br>And when you can come to the point where you say that, you&rsquo;ve reached a level of maturity and a grasp of the Christian life. No matter what I may lose, I choose the Refiner&rsquo;s fire. The Refiner&rsquo;s fire has become my soul desire, because I want to become weaker so that he may become stronger. Revealing your spiritual character, humbling you, drawing you to Himself, displaying His grace, demonstrating His power, that happens through your suffering. Embrace it and let God do His refining work.<br>(MacArthur)</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c4">1:2: MacArthur; &ldquo;The purpose of trials&rdquo;<br>1) First, trials come to test the strength of our faith. There is a great illustration of this in 2 Chronicles 32:31: &ldquo;God left [king Hezekiah] to test him that he might know all that was in his heart.&rdquo; Did you get that? That who might know? Well not God, God didn&rsquo;t need to know by testing what was Hezekiah&rsquo;s heart, he knew by omniscience right? Does God have to test you to find out what&rsquo;s in your heart? No. God doesn&rsquo;t have to test any of us to find out what&rsquo;s in our heart. &nbsp;God tests us so that we can find out. &nbsp;In other words, he assists us in doing that spiritual inventory. &nbsp;He assists us in self-examination. &nbsp;I need to know and you need to know the strength of our faith and so God brings trials into our lives to demonstrate to us the strength or weakness of our faith. &nbsp;<br>2) Secondly, we must recognize that trials come to humble us. &nbsp;They come to remind us not to think more confidently of our spiritual strength than we should. &nbsp;It&rsquo;s closely connected to the first one, but a little different. They come not only to show us our strength, but they come to humble us, lest we think we are more strong spiritually than we are. <br>3) I believe the Lord brings trials in our life also to wean us away from worldly things. &nbsp;Because it is demonstrating their utter inability to solve any problem. &nbsp;Or to provide for you any real resource in a time of stress. &nbsp;We need to be weaned away. &nbsp;<br>4) I think they call us to what we could call an eternal hope. &nbsp;Trials in life, I don&rsquo;t know how they work with you, but I know they work this way with me, trials in my life tend to make me want to go to heaven. &nbsp;Have you noticed that? &nbsp;That&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;m saying. &nbsp;I don&rsquo;t want to make it too difficult, it&rsquo;s pretty simple. &nbsp;They cause us to think on things divine, things heavenly. <br>5) Fifthly, trials also serve a very important purpose because they reveal what we really love. &nbsp;Could anything have been dearer to Abraham than Isaac, anything? &nbsp;It&rsquo;s questionable that anything could be dearer to him than Isaac. &nbsp;Anything in this world, certainly God was dearer to him than Isaac, but that was the test. &nbsp;To find out did he love Isaac more than he loved God or did he love God more than he loved Isaac, that&rsquo;s the test. &nbsp;You see trials will reveal what you really love by how you react.<br>You see, if you supremely love God, you are going to say thank you God, for what you are accomplishing through this. &nbsp;Help me to see that. &nbsp;And give you glory though you are allowing this to happen. &nbsp;But if you really love self more than God, you are going to say, God, why do you do this and you are going to be irate and you are going to be upset and you are going to be bitter. &nbsp;And you are going to be full of anxiety.<br>You see, there is a sense in which if anything is dearer to you than God, then he has to have it. &nbsp; God wanted in the case of Abraham to let Abraham and all of us find out who Abraham loves most. &nbsp;He said to him, Isaac, your only son whom you love. &nbsp;Abraham passed the test. &nbsp;Whom did Abraham love most? &nbsp;God. &nbsp;And that&rsquo;s the value of the trial. &nbsp;Abraham found he loved God most and everybody found out that. &nbsp;That&rsquo;s so important to note. &nbsp;When you go through a trial, find out what it reveals about your love.<br>6) There is a sixth purpose in trials, that really is very, very helpful, and that is this. &nbsp;Trials teach us to value the blessing of God. Reason teaches us to value the world. &nbsp;Sense, feeling, tells us to value pleasure, faith tells us to value God&rsquo;s world. God&rsquo;s word. &nbsp;God&rsquo;s favor, God&rsquo;s blessing. &nbsp;Reason says, grab what you can grab in the world and go. &nbsp;Sense and feeling says, find pleasure at any price. &nbsp;Faith says, obey the word of God and be blessed.<br>&rArr;) What is God&rsquo;s purpose as he tests us? 1) First to test the strength of our faith that we might know where our strength is or isn&rsquo;t. &nbsp;2) Secondly, to humble us lest we think more confidently of our spiritual strength than we should. 3) Thirdly, to wean us away from worldly things. 4) Fourthly, to call us to a heavenly hope so that we live in the above and not in the below. &nbsp;5) Fifthly, to reveal what we really love; &nbsp;6) To teach us to value the blessing of God and to appreciate it as it comes to us out of the times of suffering. 7) Seventh, to enable us to help others in their trial. &nbsp;To bear one another&rsquo;s burdens. &nbsp;8) And eighth, to develop enduring strength for greater usefulness, so that God can thrust us into greater places of ministry and effectiveness. &nbsp;<br>&rArr;) Now aren&rsquo;t these all worthwhile purpose. &nbsp;All these fit into the plan of God, by his grace. See, trials teach us the blessing of obedience. &nbsp;In the midst of a trial, we obey and are blessed. &nbsp;That&rsquo;s what they are intended to teach. &nbsp;They show us that obedience at all costs brings the blessing of God. <br>(MacArthur)</span></p><p class="c2"><span>1:4: </span><span class="c0">&#1058;&#1077;&#1088;&#1087;&#1077;&#1085;&#1080;&#1077;.</span><span>&nbsp;&#1063;&#1090;&#1086; &#1090;&#1072;&#1082;&#1086;&#1077; &#1093;&#1088;&#1080;&#1089;&#1090;&#1080;&#1072;&#1085;&#1089;&#1082;&#1086;&#1077; </span><span class="c0">&#1090;&#1077;&#1088;&#1087;&#1077;&#1085;&#1080;&#1077;</span><span>?
