## 1 Timothy

1:2: On **mercy** and **grace**, see Mt 5:7.

1:15: The main goal of a preacher is to humble the **sinners**. And he must understand that the **foremost** sinner the preacher himself, and it is he who needs the gospel the most. The other goal is to exalt our Savior, Jesus Christ, Who came to **save the sinners**. (J.T. Дом Отца)

5:1: Like a **thief **— only for those that have rejected Him, and for whom Jesus is not welcome. Believers would gladly accept Him.
